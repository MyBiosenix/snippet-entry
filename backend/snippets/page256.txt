“What for? Because you can’t remain like this, that’s why! You must look
things straight in the face at last, and not weep like a child and cry that God
won’t allow it. What will happen, if you should really be taken to the hospital tomorrow?
She is mad and in consumption, she’ll soon die and the children? Do
you mean to tell me Polenka won’t come to grief? Haven’t you seen children
here at the street corners sent out by their mothers to beg? I’ve found out where
those mothers live and in what surroundings. Children can’t remain children
there! At seven the child is vicious and a thief. Yet children, you know, are the
image of Christ: ‘theirs is the kingdom of Heaven.’ He bade us honour and love
them, they are the humanity of the future....”
“What’s to be done, what’s to be done?” repeated Sonia, weeping hysterically
and wringing her hands.
“What’s to be done? Break what must be broken, once for all, that’s all, and
take the suffering on oneself. What, you don’t understand? You’ll understand
later.... Freedom and power, and above all, power! Over all trembling creation
and all the ant-heap!... That’s the goal, remember that! That’s my farewell
message. Perhaps it’s the last time I shall speak to you. If I don’t come tomorrow,
you’ll hear of it all, and then remember these words. And some day
later on, in years to come, you’ll understand perhaps what they meant. If I come
to-morrow, I’ll tell you who killed Lizaveta.... Good-bye.”
Sonia started with terror.
“Why, do you know who killed her?” she asked, chilled with horror, looking
wildly at him.
“I know and will tell... you, only you. I have chosen you out. I’m not coming
to you to ask forgiveness, but simply to tell you. I chose you out long ago to hear
this, when your father talked of you and when Lizaveta was alive, I thought of it.
Good-bye, don’t shake hands. To-morrow!”
He went out. Sonia gazed at him as at a madman. But she herself was like one
insane and felt it. Her head was going round.
