“You are always thinking of something unpleasant,” he cried with aversion.
“Tfoo! How vexed I am that when I was expounding our system, I referred
prematurely to the question of personal privacy! It’s always a stumbling-block to
people like you, they turn it into ridicule before they understand it. And how
proud they are of it, too! Tfoo! I’ve often maintained that that question should
not be approached by a novice till he has a firm faith in the system. And tell me,
please, what do you find so shameful even in cesspools? I should be the first to
be ready to clean out any cesspool you like. And it’s not a question of selfsacrifice,
it’s simply work, honourable, useful work which is as good as any
other and much better than the work of a Raphael and a Pushkin, because it is
more useful.”
“And more honourable, more honourable, he-he-he!”
“What do you mean by ‘more honourable’? I don’t understand such
expressions to describe human activity. ‘More honourable,’ ‘nobler’—all those
are old-fashioned prejudices which I reject. Everything which is of use to
mankind is honourable. I only understand one word: useful! You can snigger as
much as you like, but that’s so!”
Pyotr Petrovitch laughed heartily. He had finished counting the money and
was putting it away. But some of the notes he left on the table. The “cesspool
question” had already been a subject of dispute between them. What was absurd
was that it made Lebeziatnikov really angry, while it amused Luzhin and at that
moment he particularly wanted to anger his young friend.
“It’s your ill-luck yesterday that makes you so ill-humoured and annoying,”
blurted out Lebeziatnikov, who in spite of his “independence” and his “protests”
did not venture to oppose Pyotr Petrovitch and still behaved to him with some of
the respect habitual in earlier years.
