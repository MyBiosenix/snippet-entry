“Good heavens, how does he know who killed Lizaveta? What did those
words mean? It’s awful!” But at the same time the idea did not enter her head,
not for a moment! “Oh, he must be terribly unhappy!... He has abandoned his
mother and sister.... What for? What has happened? And what had he in his
mind? What did he say to her? He had kissed her foot and said... said (yes, he
had said it clearly) that he could not live without her.... Oh, merciful heavens!”
Sonia spent the whole night feverish and delirious. She jumped up from time
to time, wept and wrung her hands, then sank again into feverish sleep and
dreamt of Polenka, Katerina Ivanovna and Lizaveta, of reading the gospel and
him... him with pale face, with burning eyes... kissing her feet, weeping.
On the other side of the door on the right, which divided Sonia’s room from
Madame Resslich’s flat, was a room which had long stood empty. A card was
fixed on the gate and a notice stuck in the windows over the canal advertising it
to let. Sonia had long been accustomed to the room’s being uninhabited. But all
that time Mr. Svidrigaïlov had been standing, listening at the door of the empty
room. When Raskolnikov went out he stood still, thought a moment, went on
tiptoe to his own room which adjoined the empty one, brought a chair and
noiselessly carried it to the door that led to Sonia’s room. The conversation had
struck him as interesting and remarkable, and he had greatly enjoyed it—so
much so that he brought a chair that he might not in the future, to-morrow, for
instance, have to endure the inconvenience of standing a whole hour, but might
listen in comfort.
