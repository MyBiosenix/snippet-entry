“Is that Terebyeva the one you said had made a third free marriage?”
“No, it’s only the second, really! But what if it were the fourth, what if it were
the fifteenth, that’s all nonsense! And if ever I regretted the death of my father
and mother, it is now, and I sometimes think if my parents were living what a
protest I would have aimed at them! I would have done something on purpose...
I would have shown them! I would have astonished them! I am really sorry there
is no one!”
“To surprise! He-he! Well, be that as you will,” Pyotr Petrovitch interrupted,
“but tell me this; do you know the dead man’s daughter, the delicate-looking
little thing? It’s true what they say about her, isn’t it?”
“What of it? I think, that is, it is my own personal conviction that this is the
normal condition of women. Why not? I mean, distinguons. In our present
society it is not altogether normal, because it is compulsory, but in the future
society it will be perfectly normal, because it will be voluntary. Even as it is, she
was quite right: she was suffering and that was her asset, so to speak, her capital
which she had a perfect right to dispose of. Of course, in the future society there
will be no need of assets, but her part will have another significance, rational and
in harmony with her environment. As to Sofya Semyonovna personally, I regard
her action as a vigorous protest against the organisation of society, and I respect
her deeply for it; I rejoice indeed when I look at her!”
“I was told that you got her turned out of these lodgings.”
Lebeziatnikov was enraged.
“That’s another slander,” he yelled. “It was not so at all! That was all Katerina
Ivanovna’s invention, for she did not understand! And I never made love to
Sofya Semyonovna! I was simply developing her, entirely disinterestedly, trying
to rouse her to protest.... All I wanted was her protest and Sofya Semyonovna
could not have remained here anyway!”
“Have you asked her to join your community?”
