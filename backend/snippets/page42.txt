“Of course, I’ve been meaning lately to go to Razumihin’s to ask for work, to
ask him to get me lessons or something...” Raskolnikov thought, “but what help
can he be to me now? Suppose he gets me lessons, suppose he shares his last
farthing with me, if he has any farthings, so that I could get some boots and
make myself tidy enough to give lessons... hm... Well and what then? What shall
I do with the few coppers I earn? That’s not what I want now. It’s really absurd
for me to go to Razumihin....”
The question why he was now going to Razumihin agitated him even more
than he was himself aware; he kept uneasily seeking for some sinister
significance in this apparently ordinary action.
“Could I have expected to set it all straight and to find a way out by means of
Razumihin alone?” he asked himself in perplexity.
He pondered and rubbed his forehead, and, strange to say, after long musing,
suddenly, as if it were spontaneously and by chance, a fantastic thought came
into his head.
“Hm... to Razumihin’s,” he said all at once, calmly, as though he had reached
a final determination. “I shall go to Razumihin’s of course, but... not now. I shall
go to him... on the next day after It, when It will be over and everything will
begin afresh....”
And suddenly he realised what he was thinking.
“After It,” he shouted, jumping up from the seat, “but is It really going to
happen? Is it possible it really will happen?” He left the seat, and went off
almost at a run; he meant to turn back, homewards, but the thought of going
home suddenly filled him with intense loathing; in that hole, in that awful little
cupboard of his, all this had for a month past been growing up in him; and he
walked on at random.
