sudden silence. It was strange.

Raskolnikov went out. He caught the sound of eager conversation on his
departure, and above the rest rose the questioning voice of Nikodim Fomitch. In
the street, his faintness passed off completely.
“A search—there will be a search at once,” he repeated to himself, hurrying
home. “The brutes! they suspect.”
His former terror mastered him completely again.
