“I’ve come to assure you that I’ve always loved you and I am glad that we are
alone, even glad Dounia is out,” he went on with the same impulse. “I have
come to tell you that though you will be unhappy, you must believe that your son
loves you now more than himself, and that all you thought about me, that I was
cruel and didn’t care about you, was all a mistake. I shall never cease to love
you.... Well, that’s enough: I thought I must do this and begin with this....”
Pulcheria Alexandrovna embraced him in silence, pressing him to her bosom
and weeping gently.
“I don’t know what is wrong with you, Rodya,” she said at last. “I’ve been
thinking all this time that we were simply boring you and now I see that there is
a great sorrow in store for you, and that’s why you are miserable. I’ve foreseen it
a long time, Rodya. Forgive me for speaking about it. I keep thinking about it
and lie awake at nights. Your sister lay talking in her sleep all last night, talking
of nothing but you. I caught something, but I couldn’t make it out. I felt all the
morning as though I were going to be hanged, waiting for something, expecting
something, and now it has come! Rodya, Rodya, where are you going? You are
going away somewhere?”
“Yes.”
“That’s what I thought! I can come with you, you know, if you need me. And
Dounia, too; she loves you, she loves you dearly—and Sofya Semyonovna may
come with us if you like. You see, I am glad to look upon her as a daughter
even... Dmitri Prokofitch will help us to go together. But... where... are you
going?”
“Good-bye, mother.”
“What, to-day?” she cried, as though losing him for ever.
“I can’t stay, I must go now....”
“And can’t I come with you?”
