This last complaint was so characteristic of Pyotr Petrovitch, that
Raskolnikov, pale with anger and with the effort of restraining it, could not help
breaking into laughter. But Pulcheria Alexandrovna was furious.
“Expenses? What expenses? Are you speaking of our trunk? But the
conductor brought it for nothing for you. Mercy on us, we have bound you!
What are you thinking about, Pyotr Petrovitch, it was you bound us, hand and
foot, not we!”
“Enough, mother, no more please,” Avdotya Romanovna implored. “Pyotr
Petrovitch, do be kind and go!”
“I am going, but one last word,” he said, quite unable to control himself.
“Your mamma seems to have entirely forgotten that I made up my mind to take
you, so to speak, after the gossip of the town had spread all over the district in
regard to your reputation. Disregarding public opinion for your sake and
reinstating your reputation, I certainly might very well reckon on a fitting return,
and might indeed look for gratitude on your part. And my eyes have only now

“Does the fellow want his head smashed?” cried Razumihin, jumping up.

distinctly, “and not a word more or...”
Pyotr Petrovitch gazed at him for some seconds with a pale face that worked
with anger, then he turned, went out, and rarely has any man carried away in his
heart such vindictive hatred as he felt against Raskolnikov. Him, and him alone,
he blamed for everything. It is noteworthy that as he went downstairs he still
imagined that his case was perhaps not utterly lost, and that, so far as the ladies
were concerned, all might “very well indeed” be set right again.
