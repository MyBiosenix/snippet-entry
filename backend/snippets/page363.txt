But no sooner had he opened the door than he stumbled upon Porfiry himself
in the passage. He was coming in to see him. Raskolnikov was dumbfounded for
a minute, but only for one minute. Strange to say, he was not very much
astonished at seeing Porfiry and scarcely afraid of him. He was simply startled,
but was quickly, instantly, on his guard. “Perhaps this will mean the end? But
how could Porfiry have approached so quietly, like a cat, so that he had heard
nothing? Could he have been listening at the door?”
“You didn’t expect a visitor, Rodion Romanovitch,” Porfiry explained,
laughing. “I’ve been meaning to look in a long time; I was passing by and
thought why not go in for five minutes. Are you going out? I won’t keep you
long. Just let me have one cigarette.”
“Sit down, Porfiry Petrovitch, sit down.” Raskolnikov gave his visitor a seat
with so pleased and friendly an expression that he would have marvelled at
himself, if he could have seen it.
The last moment had come, the last drops had to be drained! So a man will
sometimes go through half an hour of mortal terror with a brigand, yet when the
knife is at his throat at last, he feels no fear.
Raskolnikov seated himself directly facing Porfiry, and looked at him without
flinching. Porfiry screwed up his eyes and began lighting a cigarette.
“Speak, speak,” seemed as though it would burst from Raskolnikov’s heart.
“Come, why don’t you speak?”
