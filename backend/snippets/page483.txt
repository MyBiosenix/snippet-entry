For a long time Raskolnikov did not know of his mother’s death, though a
regular correspondence had been maintained from the time he reached Siberia. It
was carried on by means of Sonia, who wrote every month to the Razumihins
and received an answer with unfailing regularity. At first they found Sonia’s
letters dry and unsatisfactory, but later on they came to the conclusion that the
letters could not be better, for from these letters they received a complete picture
of their unfortunate brother’s life. Sonia’s letters were full of the most matter-offact
detail, the simplest and clearest description of all Raskolnikov’s
surroundings as a convict. There was no word of her own hopes, no conjecture
as to the future, no description of her feelings. Instead of any attempt to interpret
his state of mind and inner life, she gave the simple facts—that is, his own
words, an exact account of his health, what he asked for at their interviews, what
commission he gave her and so on. All these facts she gave with extraordinary
minuteness. The picture of their unhappy brother stood out at last with great
clearness and precision. There could be no mistake, because nothing was given
but facts.
