She made haste to smile, afraid that he might not like the reproach.
“I was silly to come away from there. What is happening there now? I wanted
to go back directly, but I kept thinking that... you would come.”
He told her that Amalia Ivanovna was turning them out of their lodging and
that Katerina Ivanovna had run off somewhere “to seek justice.”
“My God!” cried Sonia, “let’s go at once....”
And she snatched up her cape.
“It’s everlastingly the same thing!” said Raskolnikov, irritably. “You’ve no
thought except for them! Stay a little with me.”
“But... Katerina Ivanovna?”
“You won’t lose Katerina Ivanovna, you may be sure, she’ll come to you
herself since she has run out,” he added peevishly. “If she doesn’t find you here,
you’ll be blamed for it....”
Sonia sat down in painful suspense. Raskolnikov was silent, gazing at the
floor and deliberating.
“This time Luzhin did not want to prosecute you,” he began, not looking at
Sonia, “but if he had wanted to, if it had suited his plans, he would have sent you
to prison if it had not been for Lebeziatnikov and me. Ah?”
“Yes,” she assented in a faint voice. “Yes,” she repeated, preoccupied and
distressed.
“But I might easily not have been there. And it was quite an accident
Lebeziatnikov’s turning up.”
Sonia was silent.
“And if you’d gone to prison, what then? Do you remember what I said
yesterday?”
Again she did not answer. He waited.
