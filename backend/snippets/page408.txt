“Have you dined, by the way? I’ve had something and want nothing more. I
don’t drink, for instance, at all. Except for champagne I never touch anything,
and not more than a glass of that all the evening, and even that is enough to
make my head ache. I ordered it just now to wind myself up, for I am just going
off somewhere and you see me in a peculiar state of mind. That was why I hid

“What am I? You know, a gentleman, I served for two years in the cavalry,
then I knocked about here in Petersburg, then I married Marfa Petrovna and
lived in the country. There you have my biography!”

“No, a poor sort of gambler. A card-sharper—not a gambler.”
“You have been a card-sharper then?”

“It did happen. Why?”
“Why, you might have challenged them... altogether it must have been lively.”
“I won’t contradict you, and besides I am no hand at philosophy. I confess that
I hastened here for the sake of the women.”
“As soon as you buried Marfa Petrovna?”
