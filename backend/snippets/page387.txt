“Stop! Enough of your vile, nasty anecdotes, depraved vile, sensual man!”
“Schiller, you are a regular Schiller! O la vertu va-t-elle se nicher? But you
know I shall tell you these things on purpose, for the pleasure of hearing your
outcries!”
“I dare say. I can see I am ridiculous myself,” muttered Raskolnikov angrily.
Svidrigaïlov laughed heartily; finally he called Philip, paid his bill, and began
getting up.
“I say, but I am drunk, assez causé,” he said. “It’s been a pleasure.”
“I should rather think it must be a pleasure!” cried Raskolnikov, getting up.
“No doubt it is a pleasure for a worn-out profligate to describe such adventures
with a monstrous project of the same sort in his mind—especially under such
circumstances and to such a man as me.... It’s stimulating!”
“Well, if you come to that,” Svidrigaïlov answered, scrutinising Raskolnikov
with some surprise, “if you come to that, you are a thorough cynic yourself.
You’ve plenty to make you so, anyway. You can understand a great deal... and
you can do a great deal too. But enough. I sincerely regret not having had more
talk with you, but I shan’t lose sight of you.... Only wait a bit.”
Svidrigaïlov walked out of the restaurant. Raskolnikov walked out after him.
Svidrigaïlov was not however very drunk, the wine had affected him for a
moment, but it was passing off every minute. He was preoccupied with
something of importance and was frowning. He was apparently excited and
uneasy in anticipation of something. His manner to Raskolnikov had changed
during the last few minutes, and he was ruder and more sneering every moment.
Raskolnikov noticed all this, and he too was uneasy. He became very suspicious
of Svidrigaïlov and resolved to follow him.
They came out on to the pavement.
“You go to the right, and I to the left, or if you like, the other way. Only adieu,
mon plaisir, may we meet again.”
And he walked to the right towards the Hay Market.
