Without a word Sonia took out of the drawer two crosses, one of cypress
wood and one of copper. She made the sign of the cross over herself and over
him, and put the wooden cross on his neck.
“It’s the symbol of my taking up the cross,” he laughed. “As though I had not
suffered much till now! The wooden cross, that is the peasant one; the copper
one, that is Lizaveta’s—you will wear yourself, show me! So she had it on... at
that moment? I remember two things like these too, a silver one and a little ikon.
I threw them back on the old woman’s neck. Those would be appropriate now,
really, those are what I ought to put on now.... But I am talking nonsense and
forgetting what matters; I’m somehow forgetful.... You see I have come to warn
you, Sonia, so that you might know... that’s all—that’s all I came for. But I
thought I had more to say. You wanted me to go yourself. Well, now I am going
to prison and you’ll have your wish. Well, what are you crying for? You too?
Don’t. Leave off! Oh, how I hate it all!”
But his feeling was stirred; his heart ached, as he looked at her. “Why is she
grieving too?” he thought to himself. “What am I to her? Why does she weep?
Why is she looking after me, like my mother or Dounia? She’ll be my nurse.”
“Cross yourself, say at least one prayer,” Sonia begged in a timid broken
voice.
“Oh certainly, as much as you like! And sincerely, Sonia, sincerely....”
But he wanted to say something quite different.
He crossed himself several times. Sonia took up her shawl and put it over her
head. It was the green drap de dames shawl of which Marmeladov had spoken,
“the family shawl.” Raskolnikov thought of that looking at it, but he did not ask.
He began to feel himself that he was certainly forgetting things and was
disgustingly agitated. He was frightened at this. He was suddenly struck too by
the thought that Sonia meant to go with him.
