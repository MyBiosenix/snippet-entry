“Hadn’t we better ask the porter?”
“What?”
“Where she’s gone and when she’ll be back.”
“Hm.... Damn it all!... We might ask.... But you know she never does go
anywhere.”
And he once more tugged at the door-handle.
“Damn it all. There’s nothing to be done, we must go!”
“Stay!” cried the young man suddenly. “Do you see how the door shakes if
you pull it?”
“Well?”
“That shows it’s not locked, but fastened with the hook! Do you hear how the
hook clanks?”
“Well?”
“Why, don’t you see? That proves that one of them is at home. If they were all
out, they would have locked the door from the outside with the key and not with
the hook from inside. There, do you hear how the hook is clanking? To fasten the
hook on the inside they must be at home, don’t you see. So there they are sitting
inside and don’t open the door!”
“Well! And so they must be!” cried Koch, astonished. “What are they about in
there?” And he began furiously shaking the door.
“Stay!” cried the young man again. “Don’t pull at it! There must be something
wrong.... Here, you’ve been ringing and pulling at the door and still they don’t
open! So either they’ve both fainted or...”
“What?”
“I tell you what. Let’s go fetch the porter, let him wake them up.”
“All right.”
Both were going down.
“Stay. You stop here while I run down for the porter.”
“What for?”
“Well, you’d better.”
“All right.”
