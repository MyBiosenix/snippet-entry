You may be sure I don’t contradict him, hang him!
Well, would you like to do the second signature of ‘Is woman a human being?’ If
you would, take the German and pens and paper—all those are provided, and
take three roubles; for as I have had six roubles in advance on the whole thing,
three roubles come to you for your share. And when you have finished the
signature there will be another three roubles for you. And please don’t think I am
doing you a service; quite the contrary, as soon as you came in, I saw how you
could help me; to begin with, I am weak in spelling, and secondly, I am
sometimes utterly adrift in German, so that I make it up as I go along for the
most part. The only comfort is, that it’s bound to be a change for the better.
Though who can tell, maybe it’s sometimes for the worse. Will you take it?”
Raskolnikov took the German sheets in silence, took the three roubles and
without a word went out. Razumihin gazed after him in astonishment. But when
Raskolnikov was in the next street, he turned back, mounted the stairs to
Razumihin’s again and laying on the table the German article and the three
roubles, went out again, still without uttering a word.
“Are you raving, or what?” Razumihin shouted, roused to fury at last. “What
farce is this? You’ll drive me crazy too... what did you come to see me for, damn
you?”
“I don’t want... translation,” muttered Raskolnikov from the stairs.
“Then what the devil do you want?” shouted Razumihin from above.
Raskolnikov continued descending the staircase in silence.
“Hey, there! Where are you living?”
No answer.
“Well, confound you then!”
