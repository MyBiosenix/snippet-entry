“What’s your engagement, a woman?”
“Yes, a woman, a casual incident.... No, that’s not what I want to talk of.”
“And the hideousness, the filthiness of all your surroundings, doesn’t that
affect you? Have you lost the strength to stop yourself?”
“And do you pretend to strength, too? He-he-he! You surprised me just now,
Rodion Romanovitch, though I knew beforehand it would be so. You preach to
me about vice and æsthetics! You—a Schiller, you—an idealist! Of course that’s
all as it should be and it would be surprising if it were not so, yet it is strange in
reality.... Ah, what a pity I have no time, for you’re a most interesting type! And,
by-the-way, are you fond of Schiller? I am awfully fond of him.”
“But what a braggart you are,” Raskolnikov said with some disgust.
“Upon my word, I am not,” answered Svidrigaïlov laughing. “However, I
won’t dispute it, let me be a braggart, why not brag, if it hurts no one? I spent
seven years in the country with Marfa Petrovna, so now when I come across an
intelligent person like you—intelligent and highly interesting—I am simply glad
to talk and, besides, I’ve drunk that half-glass of champagne and it’s gone to my
head a little. And besides, there’s a certain fact that has wound me up
tremendously, but about that I... will keep quiet. Where are you off to?” he asked
in alarm.
Raskolnikov had begun getting up. He felt oppressed and stifled and, as it
were, ill at ease at having come here. He felt convinced that Svidrigaïlov was the
most worthless scoundrel on the face of the earth.
“A-ach! Sit down, stay a little!” Svidrigaïlov begged. “Let them bring you
some tea, anyway. Stay a little, I won’t talk nonsense, about myself, I mean. I’ll
tell you something. If you like I’ll tell you how a woman tried ‘to save’ me, as
you would call it? It will be an answer to your first question indeed, for the
woman was your sister. May I tell you? It will help to spend the time.”
