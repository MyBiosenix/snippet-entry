His mother and sister were sitting on his sofa and had been waiting an hour
and a half for him. Why had he never expected, never thought of them, though
the news that they had started, were on their way and would arrive immediately,
had been repeated to him only that day? They had spent that hour and a half
plying Nastasya with questions. She was standing before them and had told them
everything by now. They were beside themselves with alarm when they heard of
his “running away” to-day, ill and, as they understood from her story, delirious!
“Good Heavens, what had become of him?” Both had been weeping, both had
been in anguish for that hour and a half.
A cry of joy, of ecstasy, greeted Raskolnikov’s entrance. Both rushed to him.
But he stood like one dead; a sudden intolerable sensation struck him like a
thunderbolt. He did not lift his arms to embrace them, he could not. His mother
and sister clasped him in their arms, kissed him, laughed and cried. He took a
step, tottered and fell to the ground, fainting.
Anxiety, cries of horror, moans... Razumihin who was standing in the doorway
flew into the room, seized the sick man in his strong arms and in a moment had
him on the sofa.
“It’s nothing, nothing!” he cried to the mother and sister—“it’s only a faint, a
mere trifle! Only just now the doctor said he was much better, that he is perfectly
well! Water! See, he is coming to himself, he is all right again!”
And seizing Dounia by the arm so that he almost dislocated it, he made her
bend down to see that “he is all right again.” The mother and sister looked on
him with emotion and gratitude, as their Providence. They had heard already
from Nastasya all that had been done for their Rodya during his illness, by this
“very competent young man,” as Pulcheria Alexandrovna Raskolnikov called
him that evening in conversation with Dounia.
