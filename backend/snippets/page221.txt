think that there was a flat open anywhere, no, there wasn’t.”
“What do you mean?” Razumihin shouted suddenly, as though he had
reflected and realised. “Why, it was on the day of the murder the painters were at

“Foo! I have muddled it!” Porfiry slapped himself on the forehead. “Deuce
take it! This business is turning my brain!” he addressed Raskolnikov somewhat
apologetically. “It would be such a great thing for us to find out whether anyone
had seen them between seven and eight at the flat, so I fancied you could
perhaps have told us something.... I quite muddled it.”
“Then you should be more careful,” Razumihin observed grimly.
The last words were uttered in the passage. Porfiry Petrovitch saw them to the
door with excessive politeness.
They went out into the street gloomy and sullen, and for some steps they did
not say a word. Raskolnikov drew a deep breath.
