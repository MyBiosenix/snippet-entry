“I saw that the porters did not want to do what I said,” began the man; “for it’s
too late, said they, and maybe he’ll be angry that we did not come at the time. I
was vexed and I lost my sleep, and I began making inquiries. And finding out
yesterday where to go, I went to-day. The first time I went he wasn’t there, when
I came an hour later he couldn’t see me. I went the third time, and they showed
me in. I informed him of everything, just as it happened, and he began skipping
about the room and punching himself on the chest. ‘What do you scoundrels
mean by it? If I’d known about it I should have arrested him!’ Then he ran out,
called somebody and began talking to him in the corner, then he turned to me,
scolding and questioning me. He scolded me a great deal; and I told him
everything, and I told him that you didn’t dare to say a word in answer to me
yesterday and that you didn’t recognise me. And he fell to running about again
and kept hitting himself on the chest, and getting angry and running about, and
when you were announced he told me to go into the next room. ‘Sit there a bit,’
he said. ‘Don’t move, whatever you may hear.’ And he set a chair there for me
and locked me in. ‘Perhaps,’ he said, ‘I may call you.’ And when Nikolay’d been
brought he let me out as soon as you were gone. ‘I shall send for you again and
question you,’ he said.”
“And did he question Nikolay while you were there?”
“He got rid of me as he did of you, before he spoke to Nikolay.”
The man stood still, and again suddenly bowed down, touching the ground
with his finger.
“Forgive me for my evil thoughts, and my slander.”
“May God forgive you,” answered Raskolnikov.
And as he said this, the man bowed down again, but not to the ground, turned
slowly and went out of the room.
