“Make haste! Make haste!” repeated Svidrigaïlov, still without turning or
moving. But there seemed a terrible significance in the tone of that “make
haste.”
Dounia understood it, snatched up the key, flew to the door, unlocked it
quickly and rushed out of the room. A minute later, beside herself, she ran out on
to the canal bank in the direction of X. Bridge.
Svidrigaïlov remained three minutes standing at the window. At last he slowly
turned, looked about him and passed his hand over his forehead. A strange smile
contorted his face, a pitiful, sad, weak smile, a smile of despair. The blood,
which was already getting dry, smeared his hand. He looked angrily at it, then
wetted a towel and washed his temple. The revolver which Dounia had flung
away lay near the door and suddenly caught his eye. He picked it up and
examined it. It was a little pocket three-barrel revolver of old-fashioned
construction. There were still two charges and one capsule left in it. It could be
fired again. He thought a little, put the revolver in his pocket, took his hat and
went out.
