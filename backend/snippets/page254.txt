The last phrase sounded strange in his ears. And here was something new
again: the mysterious meetings with Lizaveta and both of them—religious
maniacs.
“I shall be a religious maniac myself soon! It’s infectious!”
“Read!” he cried irritably and insistently.
Sonia still hesitated. Her heart was throbbing. She hardly dared to read to him.
He looked almost with exasperation at the “unhappy lunatic.”
“What for? You don’t believe?...” she whispered softly and as it were

“Read! I want you to,” he persisted. “You used to read to Lizaveta.”
Sonia opened the book and found the place. Her hands were shaking, her

controlled the spasm in her throat and went on reading the eleventh chapter of
St. John. She went on to the nineteenth verse:
“And many of the Jews came to Martha and Mary to comfort them concerning
their brother.
