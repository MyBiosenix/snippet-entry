Drenched to the skin, he went home, locked himself in, opened the bureau,
took out all his money and tore up two or three papers. Then, putting the money
in his pocket, he was about to change his clothes, but, looking out of the window
and listening to the thunder and the rain, he gave up the idea, took up his hat and
went out of the room without locking the door. He went straight to Sonia. She
was at home.
She was not alone: the four Kapernaumov children were with her. She was
giving them tea. She received Svidrigaïlov in respectful silence, looking
wonderingly at his soaking clothes. The children all ran away at once in
indescribable terror.
Svidrigaïlov sat down at the table and asked Sonia to sit beside him. She
timidly prepared to listen.
“I may be going to America, Sofya Semyonovna,” said Svidrigaïlov, “and as I
am probably seeing you for the last time, I have come to make some
arrangements. Well, did you see the lady to-day? I know what she said to you,
you need not tell me.” (Sonia made a movement and blushed.) “Those people
have their own way of doing things. As to your sisters and your brother, they are
really provided for and the money assigned to them I’ve put into safe keeping
and have received acknowledgments. You had better take charge of the receipts,
in case anything happens. Here, take them! Well now, that’s settled. Here are
three 5-per-cent bonds to the value of three thousand roubles. Take those for
yourself, entirely for yourself, and let that be strictly between ourselves, so that
no one knows of it, whatever you hear. You will need the money, for to go on
living in the old way, Sofya Semyonovna, is bad, and besides there is no need for
it now.”
