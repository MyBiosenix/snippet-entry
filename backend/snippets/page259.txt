“We’ve plenty of time. Do you smoke? have you your own? Here, a
cigarette!” he went on, offering his visitor a cigarette. “You know I am receiving
you here, but my own quarters are through there, you know, my government
quarters. But I am living outside for the time, I had to have some repairs done
here. It’s almost finished now.... Government quarters, you know, are a capital
thing. Eh, what do you think?”
“Yes, a capital thing,” answered Raskolnikov, looking at him almost
ironically.
“A capital thing, a capital thing,” repeated Porfiry Petrovitch, as though he
had just thought of something quite different. “Yes, a capital thing,” he almost
shouted at last, suddenly staring at Raskolnikov and stopping short two steps
from him.
This stupid repetition was too incongruous in its ineptitude with the serious,
brooding and enigmatic glance he turned upon his visitor.
But this stirred Raskolnikov’s spleen more than ever and he could not resist an
ironical and rather incautious challenge.
“Tell me, please,” he asked suddenly, looking almost insolently at him and
taking a kind of pleasure in his own insolence. “I believe it’s a sort of legal rule,
a sort of legal tradition—for all investigating lawyers—to begin their attack from
afar, with a trivial, or at least an irrelevant subject, so as to encourage, or rather,
to divert the man they are cross-examining, to disarm his caution and then all at
once to give him an unexpected knock-down blow with some fatal question.
Isn’t that so? It’s a sacred tradition, mentioned, I fancy, in all the manuals of the
art?”
“Yes, yes.... Why, do you imagine that was why I spoke about government
quarters... eh?”
And as he said this Porfiry Petrovitch screwed up his eyes and winked; a
good-humoured, crafty look passed over his face. The wrinkles on his forehead
were smoothed out, his eyes contracted, his features broadened and he suddenly
went off into a nervous prolonged laugh, shaking all over and looking
Raskolnikov straight in the face.
