 I was lying at the time... well, what of it! I was
lying drunk and I heard my Sonia speaking (she is a gentle creature with a soft
little voice... fair hair and such a pale, thin little face). She said: ‘Katerina
Ivanovna, am I really to do a thing like that?’ And Darya Frantsovna, a woman
of evil character and very well known to the police, had two or three times tried
to get at her through the landlady. ‘And why not?’said Katerina Ivanovna with a
jeer, ‘you are something mighty precious to be so careful of!’ But don’t blame
her, don’t blame her, honoured sir, don’t blame her! She was not herself when
she spoke, but driven to distraction by her illness and the crying of the hungry
children; and it was said more to wound her than anything else.... For that’s
Katerina Ivanovna’s character, and when children cry, even from hunger, she
falls to beating them at once. At six o’clock I saw Sonia get up, put on her
kerchief and her cape, and go out of the room and about nine o’clock she came
back. She walked straight up to Katerina Ivanovna and she laid thirty roubles on
the table before her in silence. She did not utter a word, she did not even look at
her, she simply picked up our big green drap de dames shawl (we have a shawl,
made of drap de dames), put it over her head and face and lay down on the bed
with her face to the wall; only her little shoulders and her body kept
shuddering.... And I went on lying there, just as before.... And then I saw, young
man, I saw Katerina Ivanovna, in the same silence go up to Sonia’s little bed; she
was on her knees all the evening kissing Sonia’s feet, and would not get up, and
then they both fell asleep in each other’s arms... together, together... yes... and I...
lay drunk.”
Marmeladov stopped short, as though his voice had failed him. Then he
hurriedly filled his glass, drank, and cleared his throat.
