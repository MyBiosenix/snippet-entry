When he went into Sonia’s room, it was already getting dark. All day Sonia
had been waiting for him in terrible anxiety. Dounia had been waiting with her.
She had come to her that morning, remembering Svidrigaïlov’s words that Sonia
knew. We will not describe the conversation and tears of the two girls, and how
friendly they became. Dounia gained one comfort at least from that interview,
that her brother would not be alone. He had gone to her, Sonia, first with his
confession; he had gone to her for human fellowship when he needed it; she
would go with him wherever fate might send him. Dounia did not ask, but she
knew it was so. She looked at Sonia almost with reverence and at first almost
embarrassed her by it. Sonia was almost on the point of tears. She felt herself, on
the contrary, hardly worthy to look at Dounia. Dounia’s gracious image when
she had bowed to her so attentively and respectfully at their first meeting in
Raskolnikov’s room had remained in her mind as one of the fairest visions of her
life.
Dounia at last became impatient and, leaving Sonia, went to her brother’s
room to await him there; she kept thinking that he would come there first. When
she had gone, Sonia began to be tortured by the dread of his committing suicide,
and Dounia too feared it. But they had spent the day trying to persuade each
other that that could not be, and both were less anxious while they were together.
As soon as they parted, each thought of nothing else. Sonia remembered how
Svidrigaïlov had said to her the day before that Raskolnikov had two alternatives
—Siberia or... Besides she knew his vanity, his pride and his lack of faith.
“Is it possible that he has nothing but cowardice and fear of death to make him
live?” she thought at last in despair.
