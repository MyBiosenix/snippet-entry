“Don’t hope for it.”
“I’m sorry. But you don’t know me. Perhaps we may become better friends.”
“You think we may become friends?”
“And why not?” Svidrigaïlov said, smiling. He stood up and took his hat. “I
didn’t quite intend to disturb you and I came here without reckoning on it...
though I was very much struck by your face this morning.”
“Where did you see me this morning?” Raskolnikov asked uneasily.
“I saw you by chance.... I kept fancying there is something about you like
