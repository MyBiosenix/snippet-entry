Meanwhile the sun was setting. Sonia was standing in dejection, looking
intently out of the window, but from it she could see nothing but the
unwhitewashed blank wall of the next house. At last when she began to feel sure
of his death—he walked into the room.
She gave a cry of joy, but looking carefully into his face she turned pale.
“Yes,” said Raskolnikov, smiling. “I have come for your cross, Sonia. It was
you told me to go to the cross-roads; why is it you are frightened now it’s come
to that?”
Sonia gazed at him astonished. His tone seemed strange to her; a cold shiver
ran over her, but in a moment she guessed that the tone and the words were a
mask. He spoke to her looking away, as though to avoid meeting her eyes.
“You see, Sonia, I’ve decided that it will be better so. There is one fact.... But
it’s a long story and there’s no need to discuss it. But do you know what angers
me? It annoys me that all those stupid brutish faces will be gaping at me directly,
pestering me with their stupid questions, which I shall have to answer—they’ll
point their fingers at me.... Tfoo! You know I am not going to Porfiry, I am sick
of him. I’d rather go to my friend, the Explosive Lieutenant; how I shall surprise
him, what a sensation I shall make! But I must be cooler; I’ve become too
irritable of late. You know I was nearly shaking my fist at my sister just now,
because she turned to take a last look at me. It’s a brutal state to be in! Ah! what
am I coming to! Well, where are the crosses?”
He seemed hardly to know what he was doing. He could not stay still or
concentrate his attention on anything; his ideas seemed to gallop after one
another, he talked incoherently, his hands trembled slightly.
