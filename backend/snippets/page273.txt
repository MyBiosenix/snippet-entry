But this was only for an instant. Raskolnikov, bewildered, suddenly fell into
actual frenzy, but, strange to say, he again obeyed the command to speak quietly,
though he was in a perfect paroxysm of fury.
“I will not allow myself to be tortured,” he whispered, instantly recognising
with hatred that he could not help obeying the command and driven to even
greater fury by the thought. “Arrest me, search me, but kindly act in due form
and don’t play with me! Don’t dare!”
“Don’t worry about the form,” Porfiry interrupted with the same sly smile, as
it were, gloating with enjoyment over Raskolnikov. “I invited you to see me
quite in a friendly way.”
“I don’t want your friendship and I spit on it! Do you hear? And, here, I take
my cap and go. What will you say now if you mean to arrest me?”
He took up his cap and went to the door.
“And won’t you see my little surprise?” chuckled Porfiry, again taking him by
the arm and stopping him at the door.
He seemed to become more playful and good-humoured which maddened
Raskolnikov.
“What surprise?” he asked, standing still and looking at Porfiry in alarm.
“My little surprise, it’s sitting there behind the door, he-he-he!” (He pointed to
the locked door.) “I locked him in that he should not escape.”
“What is it? Where? What?...”
Raskolnikov walked to the door and would have opened it, but it was locked.
“It’s locked, here is the key!”
And he brought a key out of his pocket.
“You are lying,” roared Raskolnikov without restraint, “you lie, you damned
punchinello!” and he rushed at Porfiry who retreated to the other door, not at all
alarmed.
“I understand it all! You are lying and mocking so that I may betray myself to
you...”
