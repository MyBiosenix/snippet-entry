“Aren’t you half expiating your crime by facing the suffering?” she cried,
holding him close and kissing him.
“Crime? What crime?” he cried in sudden fury. “That I killed a vile noxious
insect, an old pawnbroker woman, of use to no one!... Killing her was atonement
for forty sins. She was sucking the life out of poor people. Was that a crime? I
am not thinking of it and I am not thinking of expiating it, and why are you all
rubbing it in on all sides? ‘A crime! a crime!’ Only now I see clearly the
imbecility of my cowardice, now that I have decided to face this superfluous
disgrace. It’s simply because I am contemptible and have nothing in me that I
have decided to, perhaps too for my advantage, as that... Porfiry... suggested!”
“Brother, brother, what are you saying? Why, you have shed blood?” cried
Dounia in despair.
“Which all men shed,” he put in almost frantically, “which flows and has
always flowed in streams, which is spilt like champagne, and for which men are
crowned in the Capitol and are called afterwards benefactors of mankind. Look
into it more carefully and understand it! I too wanted to do good to men and
would have done hundreds, thousands of good deeds to make up for that one
piece of stupidity, not stupidity even, simply clumsiness, for the idea was by no
means so stupid as it seems now that it has failed.... (Everything seems stupid
when it fails.) By that stupidity I only wanted to put myself into an independent
position, to take the first step, to obtain means, and then everything would have
been smoothed over by benefits immeasurable in comparison.... But I... I
couldn’t carry out even the first step, because I am contemptible, that’s what’s
the matter! And yet I won’t look at it as you do. If I had succeeded I should have
been crowned with glory, but now I’m trapped.”
