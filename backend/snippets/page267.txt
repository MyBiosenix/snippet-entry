“Porfiry Petrovitch,” he began, speaking loudly and distinctly, though his legs
trembled and he could scarcely stand. “I see clearly at last that you actually
suspect me of murdering that old woman and her sister Lizaveta. Let me tell you
for my part that I am sick of this. If you find that you have a right to prosecute
me legally, to arrest me, then prosecute me, arrest me. But I will not let myself
be jeered at to my face and worried...”
His lips trembled, his eyes glowed with fury and he could not restrain his
voice.
“I won’t allow it!” he shouted, bringing his fist down on the table. “Do you
hear that, Porfiry Petrovitch? I won’t allow it.”
“Good heavens! What does it mean?” cried Porfiry Petrovitch, apparently
quite frightened. “Rodion Romanovitch, my dear fellow, what is the matter with
you?”
“I won’t allow it,” Raskolnikov shouted again.
“Hush, my dear man! They’ll hear and come in. Just think, what could we say
to them?” Porfiry Petrovitch whispered in horror, bringing his face close to
Raskolnikov’s.
“I won’t allow it, I won’t allow it,” Raskolnikov repeated mechanically, but he
too spoke in a sudden whisper.
Porfiry turned quickly and ran to open the window.
“Some fresh air! And you must have some water, my dear fellow. You’re ill!”
and he was running to the door to call for some when he found a decanter of
water in the corner. “Come, drink a little,” he whispered, rushing up to him with
the decanter. “It will be sure to do you good.”
Porfiry Petrovitch’s alarm and sympathy were so natural that Raskolnikov was
silent and began looking at him with wild curiosity. He did not take the water,
however.
“Rodion Romanovitch, my dear fellow, you’ll drive yourself out of your mind,
I assure you, ach, ach! Have some water, do drink a little.”
He forced him to take the glass. Raskolnikov raised it mechanically to his lips,
but set it on the table again with disgust.
