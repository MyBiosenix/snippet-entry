“It’s a fact!” broke from Luzhin.
“Tell us, what more?” Dounia urged Raskolnikov.
“Then he said that he wasn’t rich and all the estate was left to his children who
are now with an aunt, then that he was staying somewhere not far from me, but
where, I don’t know, I didn’t ask....”
“But what, what does he want to propose to Dounia?” cried Pulcheria
Alexandrovna in a fright. “Did he tell you?”
“Yes.”
“What was it?”
“I’ll tell you afterwards.”
Raskolnikov ceased speaking and turned his attention to his tea.
Pyotr Petrovitch looked at his watch.
“I am compelled to keep a business engagement, and so I shall not be in your
way,” he added with an air of some pique and he began getting up.
“Don’t go, Pyotr Petrovitch,” said Dounia, “you intended to spend the
evening. Besides, you wrote yourself that you wanted to have an explanation
with mother.”
“Precisely so, Avdotya Romanovna,” Pyotr Petrovitch answered impressively,
sitting down again, but still holding his hat. “I certainly desired an explanation
with you and your honoured mother upon a very important point indeed. But as
your brother cannot speak openly in my presence of some proposals of Mr.
Svidrigaïlov, I, too, do not desire and am not able to speak openly... in the
presence of others... of certain matters of the greatest gravity. Moreover, my
most weighty and urgent request has been disregarded....”
Assuming an aggrieved air, Luzhin relapsed into dignified silence.
