Svidrigaïlov meanwhile, exactly at midnight, crossed the bridge on the way
back to the mainland. The rain had ceased and there was a roaring wind. He
began shivering, and for one moment he gazed at the black waters of the Little
Neva with a look of special interest, even inquiry. But he soon felt it very cold,
standing by the water; he turned and went towards Y. Prospect. He walked along
that endless street for a long time, almost half an hour, more than once stumbling
in the dark on the wooden pavement, but continually looking for something on
the right side of the street. He had noticed passing through this street lately that
there was a hotel somewhere towards the end, built of wood, but fairly large, and
its name he remembered was something like Adrianople. He was not mistaken:
the hotel was so conspicuous in that God-forsaken place that he could not fail to
see it even in the dark. It was a long, blackened wooden building, and in spite of
the late hour there were lights in the windows and signs of life within. He went
in and asked a ragged fellow who met him in the corridor for a room. The latter,
scanning Svidrigaïlov, pulled himself together and led him at once to a close and
tiny room in the distance, at the end of the corridor, under the stairs. There was
no other, all were occupied. The ragged fellow looked inquiringly.
“Is there tea?” asked Svidrigaïlov.
“Yes, sir.”
“What else is there?”
“Veal, vodka, savouries.”
“Bring me tea and veal.”
“And you want nothing else?” he asked with apparent surprise.
“Nothing, nothing.”
The ragged man went away, completely disillusioned.
