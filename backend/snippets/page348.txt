“Leave off, Sonia, leave off,” she shouted, speaking fast, panting and
coughing. “You don’t know what you ask; you are like a child! I’ve told you
before that I am not coming back to that drunken German. Let everyone, let all
Petersburg see the children begging in the streets, though their father was an
honourable man who served all his life in truth and fidelity, and one may say
died in the service.” (Katerina Ivanovna had by now invented this fantastic story
and thoroughly believed it.) “Let that wretch of a general see it! And you are
silly, Sonia: what have we to eat? Tell me that. We have worried you enough, I
won’t go on so! Ah, Rodion Romanovitch, is that you?” she cried, seeing
Raskolnikov and rushing up to him. “Explain to this silly girl, please, that
nothing better could be done! Even organ-grinders earn their living, and
everyone will see at once that we are different, that we are an honourable and
bereaved family reduced to beggary. And that general will lose his post, you’ll
see! We shall perform under his windows every day, and if the Tsar drives by,
I’ll fall on my knees, put the children before me, show them to him, and say
‘Defend us father.’ He is the father of the fatherless, he is merciful, he’ll protect
us, you’ll see, and that wretch of a general.... Lida, tenez vous droite! Kolya,
you’ll dance again. Why are you whimpering? Whimpering again! What are you
afraid of, stupid? Goodness, what am I to do with them, Rodion Romanovitch? If
you only knew how stupid they are! What’s one to do with such children?”
And she, almost crying herself—which did not stop her uninterrupted, rapid
flow of talk—pointed to the crying children. Raskolnikov tried to persuade her
to go home, and even said, hoping to work on her vanity, that it was unseemly
for her to be wandering about the streets like an organ-grinder, as she was
intending to become the principal of a boarding-school.
