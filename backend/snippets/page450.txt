He walked for some time through a long narrow corridor without finding
anyone and was just going to call out, when suddenly in a dark corner between
an old cupboard and the door he caught sight of a strange object which seemed
to be alive. He bent down with the candle and saw a little girl, not more than five
years old, shivering and crying, with her clothes as wet as a soaking houseflannel.
She did not seem afraid of Svidrigaïlov, but looked at him with blank
amazement out of her big black eyes. Now and then she sobbed as children do
when they have been crying a long time, but are beginning to be comforted. The
child’s face was pale and tired, she was numb with cold. “How can she have
come here? She must have hidden here and not slept all night.” He began
questioning her. The child suddenly becoming animated, chattered away in her
baby language, something about “mammy” and that “mammy would beat her,”
and about some cup that she had “bwoken.” The child chattered on without
stopping. He could only guess from what she said that she was a neglected child,
whose mother, probably a drunken cook, in the service of the hotel, whipped and
frightened her; that the child had broken a cup of her mother’s and was so
frightened that she had run away the evening before, had hidden for a long while
somewhere outside in the rain, at last had made her way in here, hidden behind
the cupboard and spent the night there, crying and trembling from the damp, the
darkness and the fear that she would be badly beaten for it. He took her in his
arms, went back to his room, sat her on the bed, and began undressing her. The
torn shoes which she had on her stockingless feet were as wet as if they had been
standing in a puddle all night. When he had undressed her, he put her on the bed,
covered her up and wrapped her in the blanket from her head downwards. She
fell asleep at once. Then he sank into dreary musing again.
