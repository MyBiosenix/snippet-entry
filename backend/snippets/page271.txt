“Good heavens! Why, I learnt it all from you yourself! You don’t notice that in
your excitement you tell me and others everything. From Razumihin, too, I
learnt a number of interesting details yesterday. No, you interrupted me, but I
must tell you that, for all your wit, your suspiciousness makes you lose the
common-sense view of things. To return to bell-ringing, for instance. I, an
examining lawyer, have betrayed a precious thing like that, a real fact (for it is a
fact worth having), and you see nothing in it! Why, if I had the slightest
suspicion of you, should I have acted like that? No, I should first have disarmed
your suspicions and not let you see I knew of that fact, should have diverted your
attention and suddenly have dealt you a knock-down blow (your expression)
saying: ‘And what were you doing, sir, pray, at ten or nearly eleven at the
murdered woman’s flat and why did you ring the bell and why did you ask about
blood? And why did you invite the porters to go with you to the police station, to
the lieutenant?’ That’s how I ought to have acted if I had a grain of suspicion of
you. I ought to have taken your evidence in due form, searched your lodging and
perhaps have arrested you, too... so I have no suspicion of you, since I have not
done that! But you can’t look at it normally and you see nothing, I say again.”
