“Another thing about Razumihin—you certainly ought to have said that he
came of his own accord, to have concealed your part in it! But you don’t conceal
it! You lay stress on his coming at your instigation.”
Raskolnikov had not done so. A chill went down his back.
“You keep telling lies,” he said slowly and weakly, twisting his lips into a
sickly smile, “you are trying again to show that you know all my game, that you
know all I shall say beforehand,” he said, conscious himself that he was not
weighing his words as he ought. “You want to frighten me... or you are simply
laughing at me...”
He still stared at him as he said this and again there was a light of intense
hatred in his eyes.
“You keep lying,” he said. “You know perfectly well that the best policy for
the criminal is to tell the truth as nearly as possible... to conceal as little as
possible. I don’t believe you!”
“What a wily person you are!” Porfiry tittered, “there’s no catching you;
you’ve a perfect monomania. So you don’t believe me? But still you do believe
me, you believe a quarter; I’ll soon make you believe the whole, because I have
a sincere liking for you and genuinely wish you good.”
Raskolnikov’s lips trembled.
“Yes, I do,” went on Porfiry, touching Raskolnikov’s arm genially, “you must
take care of your illness. Besides, your mother and sister are here now; you must
think of them. You must soothe and comfort them and you do nothing but
frighten them...”
“What has that to do with you? How do you know it? What concern is it of
yours? You are keeping watch on me and want to let me know it?”
