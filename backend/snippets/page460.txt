“I haven’t faith, but I have just been weeping in mother’s arms; I haven’t faith,
but I have just asked her to pray for me. I don’t know how it is, Dounia, I don’t
understand it.”
“Have you been at mother’s? Have you told her?” cried Dounia, horrorstricken.
“Surely you haven’t done that?”
“No, I didn’t tell her... in words; but she understood a great deal. She heard
you talking in your sleep. I am sure she half understands it already. Perhaps I did
wrong in going to see her. I don’t know why I did go. I am a contemptible
person, Dounia.”
“A contemptible person, but ready to face suffering! You are, aren’t you?”
“Yes, I am going. At once. Yes, to escape the disgrace I thought of drowning
myself, Dounia, but as I looked into the water, I thought that if I had considered
myself strong till now I’d better not be afraid of disgrace,” he said, hurrying on.
“It’s pride, Dounia.”
“Pride, Rodya.”
There was a gleam of fire in his lustreless eyes; he seemed to be glad to think
that he was still proud.
“You don’t think, sister, that I was simply afraid of the water?” he asked,
looking into her face with a sinister smile.
“Oh, Rodya, hush!” cried Dounia bitterly. Silence lasted for two minutes. He
sat with his eyes fixed on the floor; Dounia stood at the other end of the table
and looked at him with anguish. Suddenly he got up.
“It’s late, it’s time to go! I am going at once to give myself up. But I don’t
know why I am going to give myself up.”
Big tears fell down her cheeks.
“You are crying, sister, but can you hold out your hand to me?”
“You doubted it?”
She threw her arms round him.
