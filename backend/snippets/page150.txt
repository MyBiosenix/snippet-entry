All this was uttered with extreme rapidity, getting quicker and quicker, but a
cough suddenly cut short Katerina Ivanovna’s eloquence. At that instant the
dying man recovered consciousness and uttered a groan; she ran to him. The
injured man opened his eyes and without recognition or understanding gazed at
Raskolnikov who was bending over him. He drew deep, slow, painful breaths;
blood oozed at the corners of his mouth and drops of perspiration came out on
his forehead. Not recognising Raskolnikov, he began looking round uneasily.
Katerina Ivanovna looked at him with a sad but stern face, and tears trickled
from her eyes.
“My God! His whole chest is crushed! How he is bleeding,” she said in
despair. “We must take off his clothes. Turn a little, Semyon Zaharovitch, if you
can,” she cried to him.
Marmeladov recognised her.
“A priest,” he articulated huskily.
Katerina Ivanovna walked to the window, laid her head against the window
frame and exclaimed in despair:
“Oh, cursed life!”
“A priest,” the dying man said again after a moment’s silence.
“They’ve gone for him,” Katerina Ivanovna shouted to him, he obeyed her
shout and was silent. With sad and timid eyes he looked for her; she returned and
stood by his pillow. He seemed a little easier but not for long.
Soon his eyes rested on little Lida, his favourite, who was shaking in the
corner, as though she were in a fit, and staring at him with her wondering
childish eyes.
“A-ah,” he signed towards her uneasily. He wanted to say something.
“What now?” cried Katerina Ivanovna.
“Barefoot, barefoot!” he muttered, indicating with frenzied eyes the child’s
bare feet.
“Be silent,” Katerina Ivanovna cried irritably, “you know why she is
barefooted.”
