The sentence however was more merciful than could have been expected,
perhaps partly because the criminal had not tried to justify himself, but had
rather shown a desire to exaggerate his guilt. All the strange and peculiar
circumstances of the crime were taken into consideration. There could be no
doubt of the abnormal and poverty-stricken condition of the criminal at the time.
The fact that he had made no use of what he had stolen was put down partly to
the effect of remorse, partly to his abnormal mental condition at the time of the
crime. Incidentally the murder of Lizaveta served indeed to confirm the last
hypothesis: a man commits two murders and forgets that the door is open!
Finally, the confession, at the very moment when the case was hopelessly
muddled by the false evidence given by Nikolay through melancholy and
fanaticism, and when, moreover, there were no proofs against the real criminal,
no suspicions even (Porfiry Petrovitch fully kept his word)—all this did much to
soften the sentence. Other circumstances, too, in the prisoner’s favour came out
quite unexpectedly. Razumihin somehow discovered and proved that while
Raskolnikov was at the university he had helped a poor consumptive fellow
student and had spent his last penny on supporting him for six months, and when
this student died, leaving a decrepit old father whom he had maintained almost
from his thirteenth year, Raskolnikov had got the old man into a hospital and
paid for his funeral when he died. Raskolnikov’s landlady bore witness, too, that
when they had lived in another house at Five Corners, Raskolnikov had rescued
two little children from a house on fire and was burnt in doing so. This was
investigated and fairly well confirmed by many witnesses. These facts made an
impression in his favour.
