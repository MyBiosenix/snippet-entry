“Through idleness and depravity,” Raskolnikov put in.
“I certainly am idle and depraved, but your sister has such qualities that even I
could not help being impressed by them. But that’s all nonsense, as I see myself
now.”
“Have you seen that long?”
“I began to be aware of it before, but was only perfectly sure of it the day
before yesterday, almost at the moment I arrived in Petersburg. I still fancied in
Moscow, though, that I was coming to try to get Avdotya Romanovna’s hand and
to cut out Mr. Luzhin.”
“Excuse me for interrupting you; kindly be brief, and come to the object of
your visit. I am in a hurry, I want to go out...”
“With the greatest pleasure. On arriving here and determining on a certain...
journey, I should like to make some necessary preliminary arrangements. I left
my children with an aunt; they are well provided for; and they have no need of
me personally. And a nice father I should make, too! I have taken nothing but
what Marfa Petrovna gave me a year ago. That’s enough for me. Excuse me, I
am just coming to the point. Before the journey which may come off, I want to
settle Mr. Luzhin, too. It’s not that I detest him so much, but it was through him I
quarrelled with Marfa Petrovna when I learned that she had dished up this
marriage. I want now to see Avdotya Romanovna through your mediation, and if
you like in your presence, to explain to her that in the first place she will never
gain anything but harm from Mr. Luzhin. Then, begging her pardon for all past
unpleasantness, to make her a present of ten thousand roubles and so assist the
rupture with Mr. Luzhin, a rupture to which I believe she is herself not
disinclined, if she could see the way to it.”
“You are certainly mad,” cried Raskolnikov not so much angered as
astonished. “How dare you talk like that!”
