Raskolnikov got up and took his cap. Porfiry Petrovitch also rose.
“Are you going for a walk? The evening will be fine, if only we don’t have a
storm. Though it would be a good thing to freshen the air.”
He, too, took his cap.
“Porfiry Petrovitch, please don’t take up the notion that I have confessed to
you to-day,” Raskolnikov pronounced with sullen insistence. “You’re a strange
man and I have listened to you from simple curiosity. But I have admitted
nothing, remember that!”
“Oh, I know that, I’ll remember. Look at him, he’s trembling! Don’t be
uneasy, my dear fellow, have it your own way. Walk about a bit, you won’t be
able to walk too far. If anything happens, I have one request to make of you,” he
added, dropping his voice. “It’s an awkward one, but important. If anything were
to happen (though indeed I don’t believe in it and think you quite incapable of
it), yet in case you were taken during these forty or fifty hours with the notion of
putting an end to the business in some other way, in some fantastic fashion—
laying hands on yourself—(it’s an absurd proposition, but you must forgive me
for it) do leave a brief but precise note, only two lines, and mention the stone. It
will be more generous. Come, till we meet! Good thoughts and sound decisions
to you!”
Porfiry went out, stooping and avoiding looking at Raskolnikov. The latter
went to the window and waited with irritable impatience till he calculated that
Porfiry had reached the street and moved away. Then he too went hurriedly out
of the room.
