“Pyotr Petrovitch,” she cried, “protect me... you at least! Make this foolish
woman understand that she can’t behave like this to a lady in misfortune... that
there is a law for such things.... I’ll go to the governor-general himself.... She
shall answer for it.... Remembering my father’s hospitality protect these
orphans.”
“Allow me, madam.... Allow me.” Pyotr Petrovitch waved her off. “Your papa
as you are well aware I had not the honour of knowing” (someone laughed
aloud) “and I do not intend to take part in your everlasting squabbles with
Amalia Ivanovna.... I have come here to speak of my own affairs... and I want to
have a word with your stepdaughter, Sofya... Ivanovna, I think it is? Allow me to
pass.”
Pyotr Petrovitch, edging by her, went to the opposite corner where Sonia was.
Katerina Ivanovna remained standing where she was, as though thunderstruck.
She could not understand how Pyotr Petrovitch could deny having enjoyed her
father’s hospitality. Though she had invented it herself, she believed in it firmly
by this time. She was struck too by the businesslike, dry and even contemptuous
menacing tone of Pyotr Petrovitch. All the clamour gradually died away at his
entrance. Not only was this “serious business man” strikingly incongruous with
the rest of the party, but it was evident, too, that he had come upon some matter
of consequence, that some exceptional cause must have brought him and that
therefore something was going to happen. Raskolnikov, standing beside Sonia,
moved aside to let him pass; Pyotr Petrovitch did not seem to notice him. A
minute later Lebeziatnikov, too, appeared in the doorway; he did not come in,
but stood still, listening with marked interest, almost wonder, and seemed for a
time perplexed.
