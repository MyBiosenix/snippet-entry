Under his pillow lay the New Testament. He took it up mechanically. The
book belonged to Sonia; it was the one from which she had read the raising of
Lazarus to him. At first he was afraid that she would worry him about religion,
would talk about the gospel and pester him with books. But to his great surprise
she had not once approached the subject and had not even offered him the
Testament. He had asked her for it himself not long before his illness and she
brought him the book without a word. Till now he had not opened it.
He did not open it now, but one thought passed through his mind: “Can her
convictions not be mine now? Her feelings, her aspirations at least....”
She too had been greatly agitated that day, and at night she was taken ill again.
But she was so happy—and so unexpectedly happy—that she was almost
frightened of her happiness. Seven years, only seven years! At the beginning of
their happiness at some moments they were both ready to look on those seven
years as though they were seven days. He did not know that the new life would
not be given him for nothing, that he would have to pay dearly for it, that it
would cost him great striving, great suffering.
But that is the beginning of a new story—the story of the gradual renewal of a
man, the story of his gradual regeneration, of his passing from one world into
another, of his initiation into a new unknown life. That might be the subject of a
new story, but our present story is ended.
