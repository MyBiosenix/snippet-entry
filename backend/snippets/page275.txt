When he remembered the scene afterwards, this is how Raskolnikov saw it.
The noise behind the door increased, and suddenly the door was opened a
little.
“What is it?” cried Porfiry Petrovitch, annoyed. “Why, I gave orders...”
For an instant there was no answer, but it was evident that there were several
persons at the door, and that they were apparently pushing somebody back.
“What is it?” Porfiry Petrovitch repeated, uneasily.
“The prisoner Nikolay has been brought,” someone answered.
“He is not wanted! Take him away! Let him wait! What’s he doing here? How
irregular!” cried Porfiry, rushing to the door.
“But he...” began the same voice, and suddenly ceased.
Two seconds, not more, were spent in actual struggle, then someone gave a
violent shove, and then a man, very pale, strode into the room.
This man’s appearance was at first sight very strange. He stared straight
before him, as though seeing nothing. There was a determined gleam in his eyes;
at the same time there was a deathly pallor in his face, as though he were being
led to the scaffold. His white lips were faintly twitching.
He was dressed like a workman and was of medium height, very young, slim,
his hair cut in round crop, with thin spare features. The man whom he had thrust
back followed him into the room and succeeded in seizing him by the shoulder;
he was a warder; but Nikolay pulled his arm away.
Several persons crowded inquisitively into the doorway. Some of them tried to
get in. All this took place almost instantaneously.
“Go away, it’s too soon! Wait till you are sent for!... Why have you brought
him so soon?” Porfiry Petrovitch muttered, extremely annoyed, and as it were
thrown out of his reckoning.
But Nikolay suddenly knelt down.
“What’s the matter?” cried Porfiry, surprised.
“I am guilty! Mine is the sin! I am the murderer,” Nikolay articulated
suddenly, rather breathless, but speaking fairly loudly.
