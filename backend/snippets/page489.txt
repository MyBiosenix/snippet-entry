The second week in Lent, his turn came to take the sacrament with his gang.
He went to church and prayed with the others. A quarrel broke out one day, he
did not know how. All fell on him at once in a fury.
“You’re an infidel! You don’t believe in God,” they shouted. “You ought to be
killed.”
He had never talked to them about God nor his belief, but they wanted to kill
him as an infidel. He said nothing. One of the prisoners rushed at him in a
perfect frenzy. Raskolnikov awaited him calmly and silently; his eyebrows did
not quiver, his face did not flinch. The guard succeeded in intervening between
him and his assailant, or there would have been bloodshed.
There was another question he could not decide: why were they all so fond of
Sonia? She did not try to win their favour; she rarely met them, sometimes only
she came to see him at work for a moment. And yet everybody knew her, they
knew that she had come out to follow him, knew how and where she lived. She
never gave them money, did them no particular services. Only once at Christmas
she sent them all presents of pies and rolls. But by degrees closer relations
sprang up between them and Sonia. She would write and post letters for them to
their relations. Relations of the prisoners who visited the town, at their
instructions, left with Sonia presents and money for them. Their wives and
sweethearts knew her and used to visit her. And when she visited Raskolnikov at
work, or met a party of the prisoners on the road, they all took off their hats to
her. “Little mother Sofya Semyonovna, you are our dear, good little mother,”
coarse branded criminals said to that frail little creature. She would smile and
bow to them and everyone was delighted when she smiled. They even admired
her gait and turned round to watch her walking; they admired her too for being
so little, and, in fact, did not know what to admire her most for. They even came
to her for help in their illnesses.
