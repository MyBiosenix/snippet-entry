“But what would become of them?” Sonia asked faintly, gazing at him with
eyes of anguish, but not seeming surprised at his suggestion.
Raskolnikov looked strangely at her. He read it all in her face; so she must
have had that thought already, perhaps many times, and earnestly she had
thought out in her despair how to end it and so earnestly, that now she scarcely
wondered at his suggestion. She had not even noticed the cruelty of his words.
(The significance of his reproaches and his peculiar attitude to her shame she
had, of course, not noticed either, and that, too, was clear to him.) But he saw
how monstrously the thought of her disgraceful, shameful position was torturing
her and had long tortured her. “What, what,” he thought, “could hitherto have
hindered her from putting an end to it?” Only then he realised what those poor
little orphan children and that pitiful half-crazy Katerina Ivanovna, knocking her
head against the wall in her consumption, meant for Sonia.
But, nevertheless, it was clear to him again that with her character and the
amount of education she had after all received, she could not in any case remain
so. He was still confronted by the question, how could she have remained so
long in that position without going out of her mind, since she could not bring
herself to jump into the water? Of course he knew that Sonia’s position was an
exceptional case, though unhappily not unique and not infrequent, indeed; but
that very exceptionalness, her tinge of education, her previous life might, one
would have thought, have killed her at the first step on that revolting path. What
held her up—surely not depravity? All that infamy had obviously only touched
her mechanically, not one drop of real depravity had penetrated to her heart; he
saw that. He saw through her as she stood before him....
“There are three ways before her,” he thought, “the canal, the madhouse, or...
at last to sink into depravity which obscures the mind and turns the heart to
stone.”
