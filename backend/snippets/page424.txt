“That’s as you like, but Sofya Semyonovna is not at home. She has taken the
three children to an old lady of high rank, the patroness of some orphan asylums,
whom I used to know years ago. I charmed the old lady by depositing a sum of
money with her to provide for the three children of Katerina Ivanovna and
subscribing to the institution as well. I told her too the story of Sofya
Semyonovna in full detail, suppressing nothing. It produced an indescribable
effect on her. That’s why Sofya Semyonovna has been invited to call to-day at
the X. Hotel where the lady is staying for the time.”
“No matter, I’ll come all the same.”
“As you like, it’s nothing to me, but I won’t come with you; here we are at
home. By the way, I am convinced that you regard me with suspicion just
because I have shown such delicacy and have not so far troubled you with
questions... you understand? It struck you as extraordinary; I don’t mind betting
it’s that. Well, it teaches one to show delicacy!”
“And to listen at doors!”
“Ah, that’s it, is it?” laughed Svidrigaïlov. “Yes, I should have been surprised
if you had let that pass after all that has happened. Ha-ha! Though I did
understand something of the pranks you had been up to and were telling Sofya
Semyonovna about, what was the meaning of it? Perhaps I am quite behind the
times and can’t understand. For goodness’ sake, explain it, my dear boy.
Expound the latest theories!”
“You couldn’t have heard anything. You’re making it all up!”
