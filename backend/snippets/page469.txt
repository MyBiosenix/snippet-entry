He looked eagerly to right and left, gazed intently at every object and could
not fix his attention on anything; everything slipped away. “In another week,
another month I shall be driven in a prison van over this bridge, how shall I look
at the canal then? I should like to remember this!” slipped into his mind. “Look
at this sign! How shall I read those letters then? It’s written here ‘Campany,’
that’s a thing to remember, that letter a, and to look at it again in a month—how
shall I look at it then? What shall I be feeling and thinking then?... How trivial it
all must be, what I am fretting about now! Of course it must all be interesting...
in its way... (Ha-ha-ha! What am I thinking about?) I am becoming a baby, I am
showing off to myself; why am I ashamed? Foo! how people shove! that fat man
—a German he must be—who pushed against me, does he know whom he
pushed? There’s a peasant woman with a baby, begging. It’s curious that she
thinks me happier than she is. I might give her something, for the incongruity of
it. Here’s a five copeck piece left in my pocket, where did I get it? Here, here...
take it, my good woman!”
“God bless you,” the beggar chanted in a lachrymose voice.
He went into the Hay Market. It was distasteful, very distasteful to be in a
crowd, but he walked just where he saw most people. He would have given
anything in the world to be alone; but he knew himself that he would not have
remained alone for a moment. There was a man drunk and disorderly in the
crowd; he kept trying to dance and falling down. There was a ring round him.
Raskolnikov squeezed his way through the crowd, stared for some minutes at the
drunken man and suddenly gave a short jerky laugh. A minute later he had
forgotten him and did not see him, though he still stared. He moved away at last,
not remembering where he was; but when he got into the middle of the square an
emotion suddenly came over him, overwhelming him body and mind.
