“What God sends... only pray for me.” Raskolnikov went to the door, but she
clutched him and gazed despairingly into his eyes. Her face worked with terror.
“Enough, mother,” said Raskolnikov, deeply regretting that he had come.
“Not for ever, it’s not yet for ever? You’ll come, you’ll come to-morrow?”
“I will, I will, good-bye.” He tore himself away at last.
It was a warm, fresh, bright evening; it had cleared up in the morning.
Raskolnikov went to his lodgings; he made haste. He wanted to finish all before
sunset. He did not want to meet anyone till then. Going up the stairs he noticed
that Nastasya rushed from the samovar to watch him intently. “Can anyone have
come to see me?” he wondered. He had a disgusted vision of Porfiry. But
opening his door he saw Dounia. She was sitting alone, plunged in deep thought,
and looked as though she had been waiting a long time. He stopped short in the
doorway. She rose from the sofa in dismay and stood up facing him. Her eyes,
fixed upon him, betrayed horror and infinite grief. And from those eyes alone he
saw at once that she knew.
“Am I to come in or go away?” he asked uncertainly.
“I’ve been all day with Sofya Semyonovna. We were both waiting for you. We
thought that you would be sure to come there.”
Raskolnikov went into the room and sank exhausted on a chair.
“I feel weak, Dounia, I am very tired; and I should have liked at this moment
to be able to control myself.”
He glanced at her mistrustfully.
“Where were you all night?”
“I don’t remember clearly. You see, sister, I wanted to make up my mind once
for all, and several times I walked by the Neva, I remember that I wanted to end
it all there, but... I couldn’t make up my mind,” he whispered, looking at her
mistrustfully again.
“Thank God! That was just what we were afraid of, Sofya Semyonovna and I.
Then you still have faith in life? Thank God, thank God!”
Raskolnikov smiled bitterly.
