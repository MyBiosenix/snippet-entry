“From Porfiry?”
“From Porfiry.”
“What... what did he say?” Raskolnikov asked in dismay.
“He gave me a capital explanation of it. Psychologically, after his fashion.”
“He explained it? Explained it himself?”
“Yes, yes; good-bye. I’ll tell you all about it another time, but now I’m busy.
There was a time when I fancied... But no matter, another time!... What need is
there for me to drink now? You have made me drunk without wine. I am drunk,
Rodya! Good-bye, I’m going. I’ll come again very soon.”
He went out.
“He’s a political conspirator, there’s not a doubt about it,” Razumihin decided,
as he slowly descended the stairs. “And he’s drawn his sister in; that’s quite,
quite in keeping with Avdotya Romanovna’s character. There are interviews
between them!... She hinted at it too... So many of her words.... and hints... bear
that meaning! And how else can all this tangle be explained? Hm! And I was
almost thinking... Good heavens, what I thought! Yes, I took leave of my senses
and I wronged him! It was his doing, under the lamp in the corridor that day.
Pfoo! What a crude, nasty, vile idea on my part! Nikolay is a brick, for
confessing.... And how clear it all is now! His illness then, all his strange
actions... before this, in the university, how morose he used to be, how gloomy....
But what’s the meaning now of that letter? There’s something in that, too,
perhaps. Whom was it from? I suspect...! No, I must find out!”
He thought of Dounia, realising all he had heard and his heart throbbed, and
he suddenly broke into a run.
As soon as Razumihin went out, Raskolnikov got up, turned to the window,
walked into one corner and then into another, as though forgetting the smallness
of his room, and sat down again on the sofa. He felt, so to speak, renewed; again
the struggle, so a means of escape had come.
