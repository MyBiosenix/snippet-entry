“Yes, my mother and sister.”
“I’ve even had the honour and happiness of meeting your sister—a highly
cultivated and charming person. I confess I was sorry I got so hot with you.
There it is! But as for my looking suspiciously at your fainting fit—that affair
has been cleared up splendidly! Bigotry and fanaticism! I understand your
indignation. Perhaps you are changing your lodging on account of your family’s

“Oh, yes! Of course, you’ve made friends, I heard. Well, no, Zametov is not

friend. Your career is an intellectual one and you won’t be deterred by failure.

monk, a hermit!... A book, a pen behind your ear, a learned research—that’s
where your spirit soars! I am the same way myself.... Have you read

“No.”
“Oh, I have. There are a great many Nihilists about nowadays, you know, and
indeed it is not to be wondered at. What sort of days are they? I ask you. But we
thought... you are not a Nihilist of course? Answer me openly, openly!”
“N-no...”
