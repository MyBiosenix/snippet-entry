“The explosive one?”
“No, your friend Razumihin.”
“You must have a jolly life, Mr. Zametov; entrance free to the most agreeable
places. Who’s been pouring champagne into you just now?”
“We’ve just been... having a drink together.... You talk about pouring it into
me!”
“By way of a fee! You profit by everything!” Raskolnikov laughed, “it’s all
right, my dear boy,” he added, slapping Zametov on the shoulder. “I am not
speaking from temper, but in a friendly way, for sport, as that workman of yours
said when he was scuffling with Dmitri, in the case of the old woman....”
“How do you know about it?”
“Perhaps I know more about it than you do.”
“How strange you are.... I am sure you are still very unwell. You oughtn’t to
have come out.”
“Oh, do I seem strange to you?”
“Yes. What are you doing, reading the papers?”
“Yes.”
“There’s a lot about the fires.”
“No, I am not reading about the fires.” Here he looked mysteriously at
Zametov; his lips were twisted again in a mocking smile. “No, I am not reading
about the fires,” he went on, winking at Zametov. “But confess now, my dear
fellow, you’re awfully anxious to know what I am reading about?”
“I am not in the least. Mayn’t I ask a question? Why do you keep on...?”
“Listen, you are a man of culture and education?”
“I was in the sixth class at the gymnasium,” said Zametov with some dignity.
“Sixth class! Ah, my cock-sparrow! With your parting and your rings—you
are a gentleman of fortune. Foo! what a charming boy!” Here Raskolnikov broke
into a nervous laugh right in Zametov’s face. The latter drew back, more amazed
than offended.
“Foo! how strange you are!” Zametov repeated very seriously. “I can’t help
thinking you are still delirious.”
“I am delirious? You are fibbing, my cock-sparrow! So I am strange? You find
me curious, do you?”
“Yes, curious.”
