“No, Rodya. I often don’t see her; she leaves me alone. Dmitri Prokofitch
comes to see me, it’s so good of him, and he always talks about you. He loves
you and respects you, my dear. I don’t say that Dounia is very wanting in
consideration. I am not complaining. She has her ways and I have mine; she
seems to have got some secrets of late and I never have any secrets from you
two. Of course, I am sure that Dounia has far too much sense, and besides she
loves you and me... but I don’t know what it will all lead to. You’ve made me so
happy by coming now, Rodya, but she has missed you by going out; when she
comes in I’ll tell her: ‘Your brother came in while you were out. Where have you
been all this time?’ You mustn’t spoil me, Rodya, you know; come when you
can, but if you can’t, it doesn’t matter, I can wait. I shall know, anyway, that you
are fond of me, that will be enough for me. I shall read what you write, I shall
hear about you from everyone, and sometimes you’ll come yourself to see me.
What could be better? Here you’ve come now to comfort your mother, I see
that.”
Here Pulcheria Alexandrovna began to cry.
“Here I am again! Don’t mind my foolishness. My goodness, why am I sitting
here?” she cried, jumping up. “There is coffee and I don’t offer you any. Ah,
that’s the selfishness of old age. I’ll get it at once!”
“Mother, don’t trouble, I am going at once. I haven’t come for that. Please
listen to me.”
Pulcheria Alexandrovna went up to him timidly.
“Mother, whatever happens, whatever you hear about me, whatever you are
told about me, will you always love me as you do now?” he asked suddenly from
the fullness of his heart, as though not thinking of his words and not weighing
them.
“Rodya, Rodya, what is the matter? How can you ask me such a question?
Why, who will tell me anything about you? Besides, I shouldn’t believe anyone,
I should refuse to listen.”
