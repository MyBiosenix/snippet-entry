Svidrigaïlov got up and came to himself. His still trembling lips slowly broke
into an angry mocking smile.
“There is no one at home,” he said quietly and emphatically. “The landlady
has gone out, and it’s waste of time to shout like that. You are only exciting
yourself uselessly.”
“Where is the key? Open the door at once, at once, base man!”
“I have lost the key and cannot find it.”
“This is an outrage,” cried Dounia, turning pale as death. She rushed to the
furthest corner, where she made haste to barricade herself with a little table.
She did not scream, but she fixed her eyes on her tormentor and watched
every movement he made.
Svidrigaïlov remained standing at the other end of the room facing her. He
was positively composed, at least in appearance, but his face was pale as before.
The mocking smile did not leave his face.
“You spoke of outrage just now, Avdotya Romanovna. In that case you may be
sure I’ve taken measures. Sofya Semyonovna is not at home. The Kapernaumovs
are far away—there are five locked rooms between. I am at least twice as strong
as you are and I have nothing to fear, besides. For you could not complain
afterwards. You surely would not be willing actually to betray your brother?
Besides, no one would believe you. How should a girl have come alone to visit a
solitary man in his lodgings? So that even if you do sacrifice your brother, you
could prove nothing. It is very difficult to prove an assault, Avdotya
Romanovna.”
