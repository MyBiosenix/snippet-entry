“Why, you could not betray yourself any further, my dear Rodion
Romanovitch. You are in a passion. Don’t shout, I shall call the clerks.”
“You are lying! Call the clerks! You knew I was ill and tried to work me into a
frenzy to make me betray myself, that was your object! Produce your facts! I
understand it all. You’ve no evidence, you have only wretched rubbishly
suspicions like Zametov’s! You knew my character, you wanted to drive me to
fury and then to knock me down with priests and deputies.... Are you waiting for
them? eh! What are you waiting for? Where are they? Produce them?”
“Why deputies, my good man? What things people will imagine! And to do so
would not be acting in form as you say, you don’t know the business, my dear
fellow.... And there’s no escaping form, as you see,” Porfiry muttered, listening
at the door through which a noise could be heard.
“Ah, they’re coming,” cried Raskolnikov. “You’ve sent for them! You
expected them! Well, produce them all: your deputies, your witnesses, what you
like!... I am ready!”
But at this moment a strange incident occurred, something so unexpected that
neither Raskolnikov nor Porfiry Petrovitch could have looked for such a
conclusion to their interview.
