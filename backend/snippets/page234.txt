“If it hadn’t been for that, would you have given her the slip?”
“I don’t know what to say. It was scarcely the document restrained me. I
didn’t want to go anywhere else. Marfa Petrovna herself invited me to go abroad,
seeing I was bored, but I’ve been abroad before, and always felt sick there. For
no reason, but the sunrise, the bay of Naples, the sea—you look at them and it
makes you sad. What’s most revolting is that one is really sad! No, it’s better at
home. Here at least one blames others for everything and excuses oneself. I
should have gone perhaps on an expedition to the North Pole, because j’ai le vin
mauvais and hate drinking, and there’s nothing left but wine. I have tried it. But,
I say, I’ve been told Berg is going up in a great balloon next Sunday from the
Yusupov Garden and will take up passengers at a fee. Is it true?”
“Why, would you go up?”
“I... No, oh, no,” muttered Svidrigaïlov really seeming to be deep in thought.
“What does he mean? Is he in earnest?” Raskolnikov wondered.
“No, the document didn’t restrain me,” Svidrigaïlov went on, meditatively. “It
was my own doing, not leaving the country, and nearly a year ago Marfa
Petrovna gave me back the document on my name-day and made me a present of
a considerable sum of money, too. She had a fortune, you know. ‘You see how I
trust you, Arkady Ivanovitch’—that was actually her expression. You don’t
believe she used it? But do you know I managed the estate quite decently, they
know me in the neighbourhood. I ordered books, too. Marfa Petrovna at first
approved, but afterwards she was afraid of my over-studying.”
“You seem to be missing Marfa Petrovna very much?”
“Missing her? Perhaps. Really, perhaps I am. And, by the way, do you believe
in ghosts?”
“What ghosts?”
“Why, ordinary ghosts.”
“Do you believe in them?”
“Perhaps not, pour vous plaire.... I wouldn’t say no exactly.”
“Do you see them, then?”
Svidrigaïlov looked at him rather oddly.
