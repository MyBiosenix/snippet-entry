“What is your motive for such benevolence?” asked Raskolnikov.
“Ah! you sceptical person!” laughed Svidrigaïlov. “I told you I had no need of
that money. Won’t you admit that it’s simply done from humanity? She wasn’t ‘a
louse,’ you know” (he pointed to the corner where the dead woman lay), “was
she, like some old pawnbroker woman? Come, you’ll agree, is Luzhin to go on
living, and doing wicked things or is she to die? And if I didn’t help them,
Polenka would go the same way.”
He said this with an air of a sort of gay winking slyness, keeping his eyes
fixed on Raskolnikov, who turned white and cold, hearing his own phrases,
spoken to Sonia. He quickly stepped back and looked wildly at Svidrigaïlov.
“How do you know?” he whispered, hardly able to breathe.
“Why, I lodge here at Madame Resslich’s, the other side of the wall. Here is
Kapernaumov, and there lives Madame Resslich, an old and devoted friend of
mine. I am a neighbour.”
“You?”
“Yes,” continued Svidrigaïlov, shaking with laughter. “I assure you on my
honour, dear Rodion Romanovitch, that you have interested me enormously. I
told you we should become friends, I foretold it. Well, here we have. And you
will see what an accommodating person I am. You’ll see that you can get on with
me!”
