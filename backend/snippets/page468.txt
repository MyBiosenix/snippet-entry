“What are you doing? Where are you going? Stay here, stay! I’ll go alone,” he
cried in cowardly vexation, and almost resentful, he moved towards the door.
“What’s the use of going in procession?” he muttered going out.
Sonia remained standing in the middle of the room. He had not even said
good-bye to her; he had forgotten her. A poignant and rebellious doubt surged in
his heart.
“Was it right, was it right, all this?” he thought again as he went down the
stairs. “Couldn’t he stop and retract it all... and not go?”
But still he went. He felt suddenly once for all that he mustn’t ask himself
questions. As he turned into the street he remembered that he had not said goodbye
to Sonia, that he had left her in the middle of the room in her green shawl,
not daring to stir after he had shouted at her, and he stopped short for a moment.
At the same instant, another thought dawned upon him, as though it had been
lying in wait to strike him then.
“Why, with what object did I go to her just now? I told her—on business; on
what business? I had no sort of business! To tell her I was going; but where was
the need? Do I love her? No, no, I drove her away just now like a dog. Did I
want her crosses? Oh, how low I’ve sunk! No, I wanted her tears, I wanted to see
her terror, to see how her heart ached! I had to have something to cling to,
something to delay me, some friendly face to see! And I dared to believe in
myself, to dream of what I would do! I am a beggarly contemptible wretch,
contemptible!”
He walked along the canal bank, and he had not much further to go. But on
reaching the bridge he stopped and turning out of his way along it went to the
Hay Market.
