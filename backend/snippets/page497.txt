“And how well he does it all,” the mother was thinking to herself. “What
generous impulses he has, and how simply, how delicately he put an end to all
the misunderstanding with his sister—simply by holding out his hand at the right
minute and looking at her like that.... And what fine eyes he has, and how fine
his whole face is!... He is even better looking than Dounia.... But, good heavens,
what a suit—how terribly he’s dressed!... Vasya, the messenger boy in Afanasy
Ivanitch’s shop, is better dressed! I could rush at him and hug him... weep over
him—but I am afraid.... Oh, dear, he’s so strange! He’s talking kindly, but I’m
afraid! Why, what am I afraid of?...”
“Oh, Rodya, you wouldn’t believe,” she began suddenly, in haste to answer
his words to her, “how unhappy Dounia and I were yesterday! Now that it’s all
over and done with and we are quite happy again—I can tell you. Fancy, we ran
here almost straight from the train to embrace you and that woman—ah, here she
is! Good morning, Nastasya!... She told us at once that you were lying in a high
fever and had just run away from the doctor in delirium, and they were looking
for you in the streets. You can’t imagine how we felt! I couldn’t help thinking of
the tragic end of Lieutenant Potanchikov, a friend of your father’s—you can’t
remember him, Rodya—who ran out in the same way in a high fever and fell
into the well in the court-yard and they couldn’t pull him out till next day. Of
course, we exaggerated things. We were on the point of rushing to find Pyotr
Petrovitch to ask him to help.... Because we were alone, utterly alone,” she said
plaintively and stopped short, suddenly, recollecting it was still somewhat
dangerous to speak of Pyotr Petrovitch, although “we are quite happy again.”
