“I have. Luzhin charged you with having caused the death of a child. Is that
true?”
“Don’t refer to those vulgar tales, I beg,” said Svidrigaïlov with disgust and
annoyance. “If you insist on wanting to know about all that idiocy, I will tell you
one day, but now...”
“I was told too about some footman of yours in the country whom you treated
badly.”
“I beg you to drop the subject,” Svidrigaïlov interrupted again with obvious
impatience.
“Was that the footman who came to you after death to fill your pipe?... you
told me about it yourself.” Raskolnikov felt more and more irritated.
Svidrigaïlov looked at him attentively and Raskolnikov fancied he caught a
flash of spiteful mockery in that look. But Svidrigaïlov restrained himself and
answered very civilly:
“Yes, it was. I see that you, too, are extremely interested and shall feel it my
duty to satisfy your curiosity at the first opportunity. Upon my soul! I see that I
really might pass for a romantic figure with some people. Judge how grateful I
must be to Marfa Petrovna for having repeated to Avdotya Romanovna such
mysterious and interesting gossip about me. I dare not guess what impression it
made on her, but in any case it worked in my interests. With all Avdotya
Romanovna’s natural aversion and in spite of my invariably gloomy and
repellent aspect—she did at least feel pity for me, pity for a lost soul. And if
once a girl’s heart is moved to pity, it’s more dangerous than anything. She is
bound to want to ‘save him,’ to bring him to his senses, and lift him up and draw
him to nobler aims, and restore him to new life and usefulness—well, we all
know how far such dreams can go. I saw at once that the bird was flying into the
cage of herself.
