“I don’t believe it, I can’t believe it!” repeated Razumihin, trying in perplexity
to refute Raskolnikov’s arguments.
They were by now approaching Bakaleyev’s lodgings, where Pulcheria
Alexandrovna and Dounia had been expecting them a long while. Razumihin
kept stopping on the way in the heat of discussion, confused and excited by the
very fact that they were for the first time speaking openly about it.
“Don’t believe it, then!” answered Raskolnikov, with a cold, careless smile.
“You were noticing nothing as usual, but I was weighing every word.”
“You are suspicious. That is why you weighed their words... h’m... certainly, I
agree, Porfiry’s tone was rather strange, and still more that wretch Zametov!...
You are right, there was something about him—but why? Why?”
“He has changed his mind since last night.”
“Quite the contrary! If they had that brainless idea, they would do their utmost
to hide it, and conceal their cards, so as to catch you afterwards.... But it was all
impudent and careless.”
“If they had had facts—I mean, real facts—or at least grounds for suspicion,
then they would certainly have tried to hide their game, in the hope of getting
more (they would have made a search long ago besides). But they have no facts,
not one. It is all mirage—all ambiguous. Simply a floating idea. So they try to
throw me out by impudence. And perhaps, he was irritated at having no facts,
and blurted it out in his vexation—or perhaps he has some plan... he seems an
intelligent man. Perhaps he wanted to frighten me by pretending to know. They
have a psychology of their own, brother. But it is loathsome explaining it all.
Stop!”
