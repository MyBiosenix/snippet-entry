He had spoken the truth, moreover, when he blurted out in his drunken talk on
the stairs that Praskovya Pavlovna, Raskolnikov’s eccentric landlady, would be
jealous of Pulcheria Alexandrovna as well as of Avdotya Romanovna on his
account. Although Pulcheria Alexandrovna was forty-three, her face still
retained traces of her former beauty; she looked much younger than her age,
indeed, which is almost always the case with women who retain serenity of
spirit, sensitiveness and pure sincere warmth of heart to old age. We may add in
parenthesis that to preserve all this is the only means of retaining beauty to old
age. Her hair had begun to grow grey and thin, there had long been little crow’s
foot wrinkles round her eyes, her cheeks were hollow and sunken from anxiety
and grief, and yet it was a handsome face. She was Dounia over again, twenty
years older, but without the projecting underlip. Pulcheria Alexandrovna was
emotional, but not sentimental, timid and yielding, but only to a certain point.
She could give way and accept a great deal even of what was contrary to her
convictions, but there was a certain barrier fixed by honesty, principle and the
deepest convictions which nothing would induce her to cross.
Exactly twenty minutes after Razumihin’s departure, there came two subdued
but hurried knocks at the door: he had come back.
“I won’t come in, I haven’t time,” he hastened to say when the door was
opened. “He sleeps like a top, soundly, quietly, and God grant he may sleep ten
hours. Nastasya’s with him; I told her not to leave till I came. Now I am fetching
Zossimov, he will report to you and then you’d better turn in; I can see you are
too tired to do anything....”
And he ran off down the corridor.
“What a very competent and... devoted young man!” cried Pulcheria
Alexandrovna exceedingly delighted.
“He seems a splendid person!” Avdotya Romanovna replied with some
warmth, resuming her walk up and down the room.
