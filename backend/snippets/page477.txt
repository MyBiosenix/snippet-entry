Siberia. On the banks of a broad solitary river stands a town, one of the
administrative centres of Russia; in the town there is a fortress, in the fortress
there is a prison. In the prison the second-class convict Rodion Raskolnikov has
been confined for nine months. Almost a year and a half has passed since his
crime.
There had been little difficulty about his trial. The criminal adhered exactly,
firmly, and clearly to his statement. He did not confuse nor misrepresent the
facts, nor soften them in his own interest, nor omit the smallest detail. He
explained every incident of the murder, the secret of the pledge (the piece of
wood with a strip of metal) which was found in the murdered woman’s hand. He
described minutely how he had taken her keys, what they were like, as well as
the chest and its contents; he explained the mystery of Lizaveta’s murder;
described how Koch and, after him, the student knocked, and repeated all they
had said to one another; how he afterwards had run downstairs and heard
Nikolay and Dmitri shouting; how he had hidden in the empty flat and
afterwards gone home. He ended by indicating the stone in the yard off the
Voznesensky Prospect under which the purse and the trinkets were found. The
whole thing, in fact, was perfectly clear. The lawyers and the judges were very
much struck, among other things, by the fact that he had hidden the trinkets and
the purse under a stone, without making use of them, and that, what was more,
he did not now remember what the trinkets were like, or even how many there
were. The fact that he had never opened the purse and did not even know how
much was in it seemed incredible. There turned out to be in the purse three
hundred and seventeen roubles and sixty copecks. From being so long under the
stone, some of the most valuable notes lying uppermost had suffered from the
damp.
