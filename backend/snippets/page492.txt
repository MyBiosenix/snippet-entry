There there was freedom, there other men were living, utterly
unlike those here; there time itself seemed to stand still, as though the age of
Abraham and his flocks had not passed. Raskolnikov sat gazing, his thoughts
passed into day-dreams, into contemplation; he thought of nothing, but a vague
restlessness excited and troubled him. Suddenly he found Sonia beside him; she
had come up noiselessly and sat down at his side. It was still quite early; the
morning chill was still keen. She wore her poor old burnous and the green shawl;
her face still showed signs of illness, it was thinner and paler. She gave him a
joyful smile of welcome, but held out her hand with her usual timidity. She was
always timid of holding out her hand to him and sometimes did not offer it at all,
as though afraid he would repel it. He always took her hand as though with
repugnance, always seemed vexed to meet her and was sometimes obstinately
silent throughout her visit. Sometimes she trembled before him and went away
deeply grieved. But now their hands did not part. He stole a rapid glance at her
and dropped his eyes on the ground without speaking. They were alone, no one
had seen them. The guard had turned away for the time.
