“Svidrigaïlov,” someone answered from the other room with drowsy
listlessness.
Raskolnikov started.
“Svidrigaïlov! Svidrigaïlov has shot himself!” he cried.
“What, do you know Svidrigaïlov?”
“Yes... I knew him.... He hadn’t been here long.”
“Yes, that’s so. He had lost his wife, was a man of reckless habits and all of a
sudden shot himself, and in such a shocking way.... He left in his notebook a few
words: that he dies in full possession of his faculties and that no one is to blame
for his death. He had money, they say. How did you come to know him?”
“I... was acquainted... my sister was governess in his family.”
“Bah-bah-bah! Then no doubt you can tell us something about him. You had
no suspicion?”
“I saw him yesterday... he... was drinking wine; I knew nothing.”
Raskolnikov felt as though something had fallen on him and was stifling him.
“You’ve turned pale again. It’s so stuffy here...”
“Yes, I must go,” muttered Raskolnikov. “Excuse my troubling you....”
“Oh, not at all, as often as you like. It’s a pleasure to see you and I am glad to
say so.”
Ilya Petrovitch held out his hand.
“I only wanted... I came to see Zametov.”
“I understand, I understand, and it’s a pleasure to see you.”
“I... am very glad... good-bye,” Raskolnikov smiled.
He went out; he reeled, he was overtaken with giddiness and did not know
what he was doing. He began going down the stairs, supporting himself with his
right hand against the wall. He fancied that a porter pushed past him on his way
upstairs to the police office, that a dog in the lower storey kept up a shrill
barking and that a woman flung a rolling-pin at it and shouted. He went down
and out into the yard. There, not far from the entrance, stood Sonia, pale and
horror-stricken. She looked wildly at him. He stood still before her. There was a
look of poignant agony, of despair, in her face. She clasped her hands. His lips
worked in an ugly, meaningless smile. He stood still a minute, grinned and went
back to the police office.
