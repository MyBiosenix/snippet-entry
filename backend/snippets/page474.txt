“Believe me, you can speak openly to me as you would to yourself! Official
duty is one thing but... you are thinking I meant to say friendship is quite
another? No, you’re wrong! It’s not friendship, but the feeling of a man and a
citizen, the feeling of humanity and of love for the Almighty. I may be an
official, but I am always bound to feel myself a man and a citizen.... You were
asking about Zametov. Zametov will make a scandal in the French style in a
house of bad reputation, over a glass of champagne... that’s all your Zametov is
good for! While I’m perhaps, so to speak, burning with devotion and lofty
feelings, and besides I have rank, consequence, a post! I am married and have
children, I fulfil the duties of a man and a citizen, but who is he, may I ask? I
appeal to you as a man ennobled by education... Then these midwives, too, have
become extraordinarily numerous.”
Raskolnikov raised his eyebrows inquiringly. The words of Ilya Petrovitch,
who had obviously been dining, were for the most part a stream of empty sounds
for him. But some of them he understood. He looked at him inquiringly, not
knowing how it would end.
“I mean those crop-headed wenches,” the talkative Ilya Petrovitch continued.
“Midwives is my name for them. I think it a very satisfactory one, ha-ha! They
go to the Academy, study anatomy. If I fall ill, am I to send for a young lady to
treat me? What do you say? Ha-ha!” Ilya Petrovitch laughed, quite pleased with
his own wit. “It’s an immoderate zeal for education, but once you’re educated,
that’s enough. Why abuse it? Why insult honourable people, as that scoundrel
Zametov does? Why did he insult me, I ask you? Look at these suicides, too,
how common they are, you can’t fancy! People spend their last halfpenny and
kill themselves, boys and girls and old people. Only this morning we heard about
a gentleman who had just come to town. Nil Pavlitch, I say, what was the name
of that gentleman who shot himself?”
