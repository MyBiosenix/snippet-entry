The same day, about seven o’clock in the evening, Raskolnikov was on his
way to his mother’s and sister’s lodging—the lodging in Bakaleyev’s house
which Razumihin had found for them. The stairs went up from the street.
Raskolnikov walked with lagging steps, as though still hesitating whether to go
or not. But nothing would have turned him back: his decision was taken.
“Besides, it doesn’t matter, they still know nothing,” he thought, “and they are
used to thinking of me as eccentric.”
He was appallingly dressed: his clothes torn and dirty, soaked with a night’s
rain. His face was almost distorted from fatigue, exposure, the inward conflict
that had lasted for twenty-four hours. He had spent all the previous night alone,
God knows where. But anyway he had reached a decision.
He knocked at the door which was opened by his mother. Dounia was not at
home. Even the servant happened to be out. At first Pulcheria Alexandrovna was
speechless with joy and surprise; then she took him by the hand and drew him
into the room.
“Here you are!” she began, faltering with joy. “Don’t be angry with me,
Rodya, for welcoming you so foolishly with tears: I am laughing not crying. Did
you think I was crying? No, I am delighted, but I’ve got into such a stupid habit
of shedding tears. I’ve been like that ever since your father’s death. I cry for
anything. Sit down, dear boy, you must be tired; I see you are. Ah, how muddy
you are.”
“I was in the rain yesterday, mother....” Raskolnikov began.
