Dounia said this, speaking hurriedly, and for an instant the colour rushed to
her face.
“If you didn’t believe it, how could you risk coming alone to my rooms? Why
have you come? Simply from curiosity?”
“Don’t torment me. Speak, speak!”
“There’s no denying that you are a brave girl. Upon my word, I thought you
would have asked Mr. Razumihin to escort you here. But he was not with you
nor anywhere near. I was on the look-out. It’s spirited of you, it proves you
wanted to spare Rodion Romanovitch. But everything is divine in you.... About
your brother, what am I to say to you? You’ve just seen him yourself. What did
you think of him?”
“Surely that’s not the only thing you are building on?”
“No, not on that, but on his own words. He came here on two successive
evenings to see Sofya Semyonovna. I’ve shown you where they sat. He made a
full confession to her. He is a murderer. He killed an old woman, a pawnbroker,
with whom he had pawned things himself. He killed her sister too, a pedlar
woman called Lizaveta, who happened to come in while he was murdering her
sister. He killed them with an axe he brought with him. He murdered them to rob
them and he did rob them. He took money and various things.... He told all this,
word for word, to Sofya Semyonovna, the only person who knows his secret.
But she has had no share by word or deed in the murder; she was as horrified at
it as you are now. Don’t be anxious, she won’t betray him.”
“It cannot be,” muttered Dounia, with white lips. She gasped for breath. “It
cannot be. There was not the slightest cause, no sort of ground.... It’s a lie, a lie!”
