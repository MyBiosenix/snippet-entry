“Nobody asks you for these personal details, sir, we’ve no time to waste,” Ilya
Petrovitch interposed roughly and with a note of triumph; but Raskolnikov
stopped him hotly, though he suddenly found it exceedingly difficult to speak.
“But excuse me, excuse me. It is for me to explain... how it all happened... In
my turn... though I agree with you... it is unnecessary. But a year ago, the girl
died of typhus. I remained lodging there as before, and when my landlady
moved into her present quarters, she said to me... and in a friendly way... that she
had complete trust in me, but still, would I not give her an I O U for one hundred
and fifteen roubles, all the debt I owed her. She said if only I gave her that, she
would trust me again, as much as I liked, and that she would never, never—those
were her own words—make use of that I O U till I could pay of myself... and
now, when I have lost my lessons and have nothing to eat, she takes action
against me. What am I to say to that?”
“All these affecting details are no business of ours.” Ilya Petrovitch
interrupted rudely. “You must give a written undertaking but as for your love
affairs and all these tragic events, we have nothing to do with that.”
“Come now... you are harsh,” muttered Nikodim Fomitch, sitting down at the
table and also beginning to write. He looked a little ashamed.
“Write!” said the head clerk to Raskolnikov.
“Write what?” the latter asked, gruffly.
“I will dictate to you.”
