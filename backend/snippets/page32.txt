precious Rodya, I embrace
you and send you a mother’s blessing till we meet. Love Dounia your sister,
Rodya; love her as she loves you and understand that she loves you beyond
everything, more than herself. She is an angel and you, Rodya, you are
everything to us—our one hope, our one consolation. If only you are happy, we
shall be happy. Do you still say your prayers, Rodya, and believe in the mercy of
our Creator and our Redeemer? I am afraid in my heart that you may have been
visited by the new spirit of infidelity that is abroad to-day; If it is so, I pray for
you. Remember, dear boy, how in your childhood, when your father was living,
you used to lisp your prayers at my knee, and how happy we all were in those
days. Good-bye, till we meet then—I embrace you warmly, warmly, with many
kisses.
“Yours till death,
“PULCHERIA RASKOLNIKOV.”
Almost from the first, while he read the letter, Raskolnikov’s face was wet
with tears; but when he finished it, his face was pale and distorted and a bitter,
wrathful and malignant smile was on his lips. He laid his head down on his
threadbare dirty pillow and pondered, pondered a long time. His heart was
beating violently, and his brain was in a turmoil. At last he felt cramped and
stifled in the little yellow room that was like a cupboard or a box. His eyes and
his mind craved for space. He took up his hat and went out, this time without
dread of meeting anyone; he had forgotten his dread. He turned in the direction
of the Vassilyevsky Ostrov, walking along Vassilyevsky Prospect, as though
hastening on some business, but he walked, as his habit was, without noticing his
way, muttering and even speaking aloud to himself, to the astonishment of the
passers-by. Many of them took him to be drunk.
