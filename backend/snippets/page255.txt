Raskolnikov turned and looked at her with emotion. Yes, he had known it!
She was trembling in a real physical fever. He had expected it. She was getting
near the story of the greatest miracle and a feeling of immense triumph came
over her. Her voice rang out like a bell; triumph and joy gave it power. The lines
danced before her eyes, but she knew what she was reading by heart. At the last
verse “Could not this Man which opened the eyes of the blind...” dropping her
voice she passionately reproduced the doubt, the reproach and censure of the
blind disbelieving Jews, who in another moment would fall at His feet as though
struck by thunder, sobbing and believing.... “And he, he—too, is blinded and
unbelieving, he, too, will hear, he, too, will believe, yes, yes! At once, now,” was
what she was dreaming, and she was quivering with happy anticipation.
“Jesus therefore again groaning in Himself cometh to the grave. It was a cave,
and a stone lay upon it.
“Jesus said, Take ye away the stone. Martha, the sister of him that was dead,
saith unto Him, Lord by this time he stinketh: for he hath been dead four days.”
She laid emphasis on the word four.
“Jesus saith unto her, Said I not unto thee that if thou wouldest believe, thou
shouldest see the glory of God?
“Then they took away the stone from the place where the dead was laid. And
Jesus lifted up His eyes and said, Father, I thank Thee that Thou hast heard Me.
“And I knew that Thou hearest Me always; but because of the people which
stand by I said it, that they may believe that Thou hast sent Me.
“And when He thus had spoken, He cried with a loud voice, Lazarus, come
forth.
“And he that was dead came forth.”
(She read loudly, cold and trembling with ecstasy, as though she were seeing it
before her eyes.)
