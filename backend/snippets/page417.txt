Svidrigaïlov struck the table with his fist impatiently. He was flushed.
Raskolnikov saw clearly that the glass or glass and a half of champagne that he
had sipped almost unconsciously was affecting him—and he resolved to take
advantage of the opportunity. He felt very suspicious of Svidrigaïlov.
“Well, after what you have said, I am fully convinced that you have come to
Petersburg with designs on my sister,” he said directly to Svidrigaïlov, in order to
irritate him further.
“Oh, nonsense,” said Svidrigaïlov, seeming to rouse himself. “Why, I told
you... besides your sister can’t endure me.”
“Yes, I am certain that she can’t, but that’s not the point.”
“Are you so sure that she can’t?” Svidrigaïlov screwed up his eyes and smiled
mockingly. “You are right, she doesn’t love me, but you can never be sure of
what has passed between husband and wife or lover and mistress. There’s always
a little corner which remains a secret to the world and is only known to those
two. Will you answer for it that Avdotya Romanovna regarded me with
aversion?”
“From some words you’ve dropped, I notice that you still have designs—and
of course evil ones—on Dounia and mean to carry them out promptly.”
“What, have I dropped words like that?” Svidrigaïlov asked in naïve dismay,
taking not the slightest notice of the epithet bestowed on his designs.
“Why, you are dropping them even now. Why are you so frightened? What are
you so afraid of now?”
