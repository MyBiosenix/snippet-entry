“It must be a nice place,” thought Svidrigaïlov. “How was it I didn’t know it?
I expect I look as if I came from a café chantant and have had some adventure on
the way. It would be interesting to know who stayed here?”
He lighted the candle and looked at the room more carefully. It was a room so
low-pitched that Svidrigaïlov could only just stand up in it; it had one window;
the bed, which was very dirty, and the plain-stained chair and table almost filled
it up. The walls looked as though they were made of planks, covered with
shabby paper, so torn and dusty that the pattern was indistinguishable, though the
general colour—yellow—could still be made out. One of the walls was cut short
by the sloping ceiling, though the room was not an attic but just under the stairs.
Svidrigaïlov set down the candle, sat down on the bed and sank into thought.
But a strange persistent murmur which sometimes rose to a shout in the next
room attracted his attention. The murmur had not ceased from the moment he
entered the room. He listened: someone was upbraiding and almost tearfully
scolding, but he heard only one voice.
Svidrigaïlov got up, shaded the light with his hand and at once he saw light
through a crack in the wall; he went up and peeped through. The room, which
was somewhat larger than his, had two occupants. One of them, a very curlyheaded
man with a red inflamed face, was standing in the pose of an orator,
without his coat, with his legs wide apart to preserve his balance, and smiting
himself on the breast.
