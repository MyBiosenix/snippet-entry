“I am so much indebted to you, and so are the children and my stepmother,”
said Sonia hurriedly, “and if I’ve said so little... please don’t consider...”
“That’s enough! that’s enough!”
“But as for the money, Arkady Ivanovitch, I am very grateful to you, but I
don’t need it now. I can always earn my own living. Don’t think me ungrateful.
If you are so charitable, that money....”
“It’s for you, for you, Sofya Semyonovna, and please don’t waste words over
it. I haven’t time for it. You will want it. Rodion Romanovitch has two
alternatives: a bullet in the brain or Siberia.” (Sonia looked wildly at him, and
started.) “Don’t be uneasy, I know all about it from himself and I am not a
gossip; I won’t tell anyone. It was good advice when you told him to give
himself up and confess. It would be much better for him. Well, if it turns out to
be Siberia, he will go and you will follow him. That’s so, isn’t it? And if so,
you’ll need money. You’ll need it for him, do you understand? Giving it to you is
the same as my giving it to him. Besides, you promised Amalia Ivanovna to pay
what’s owing. I heard you. How can you undertake such obligations so
heedlessly, Sofya Semyonovna? It was Katerina Ivanovna’s debt and not yours,
so you ought not to have taken any notice of the German woman. You can’t get
through the world like that. If you are ever questioned about me—to-morrow or
the day after you will be asked—don’t say anything about my coming to see you
now and don’t show the money to anyone or say a word about it. Well, now
good-bye.” (He got up.) “My greetings to Rodion Romanovitch. By the way,
you’d better put the money for the present in Mr. Razumihin’s keeping. You
know Mr. Razumihin? Of course you do. He’s not a bad fellow. Take it to him
to-morrow or... when the time comes. And till then, hide it carefully.”
