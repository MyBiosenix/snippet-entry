Svidrigaïlov came to himself, got up from the bed and went to the window. He
felt for the latch and opened it. The wind lashed furiously into the little room and
stung his face and his chest, only covered with his shirt, as though with frost.
Under the window there must have been something like a garden, and apparently
a pleasure garden. There, too, probably there were tea-tables and singing in the
daytime. Now drops of rain flew in at the window from the trees and bushes; it
was dark as in a cellar, so that he could only just make out some dark blurs of
objects. Svidrigaïlov, bending down with elbows on the window-sill, gazed for
five minutes into the darkness; the boom of a cannon, followed by a second one,
resounded in the darkness of the night. “Ah, the signal! The river is
overflowing,” he thought. “By morning it will be swirling down the street in the
lower parts, flooding the basements and cellars. The cellar rats will swim out,
and men will curse in the rain and wind as they drag their rubbish to their upper
storeys. What time is it now?” And he had hardly thought it when, somewhere
near, a clock on the wall, ticking away hurriedly, struck three.
“Aha! It will be light in an hour! Why wait? I’ll go out at once straight to the
park. I’ll choose a great bush there drenched with rain, so that as soon as one’s
shoulder touches it, millions of drops drip on one’s head.”
He moved away from the window, shut it, lighted the candle, put on his
waistcoat, his overcoat and his hat and went out, carrying the candle, into the
passage to look for the ragged attendant who would be asleep somewhere in the
midst of candle-ends and all sorts of rubbish, to pay him for the room and leave
the hotel. “It’s the best minute; I couldn’t choose a better.”
