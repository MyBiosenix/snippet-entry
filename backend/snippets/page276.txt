For ten seconds there was silence as though all had been struck dumb; even
the warder stepped back, mechanically retreated to the door, and stood
immovable.
“What is it?” cried Porfiry Petrovitch, recovering from his momentary
stupefaction.
“I... am the murderer,” repeated Nikolay, after a brief pause.
“What... you... what... whom did you kill?” Porfiry Petrovitch was obviously
bewildered.
Nikolay again was silent for a moment.
“Alyona Ivanovna and her sister Lizaveta Ivanovna, I... killed... with an axe.
Darkness came over me,” he added suddenly, and was again silent.
He still remained on his knees. Porfiry Petrovitch stood for some moments as
though meditating, but suddenly roused himself and waved back the uninvited
spectators. They instantly vanished and closed the door. Then he looked towards
Raskolnikov, who was standing in the corner, staring wildly at Nikolay and
moved towards him, but stopped short, looked from Nikolay to Raskolnikov and
then again at Nikolay, and seeming unable to restrain himself darted at the latter.
“You’re in too great a hurry,” he shouted at him, almost angrily. “I didn’t ask
you what came over you.... Speak, did you kill them?”
“I am the murderer.... I want to give evidence,” Nikolay pronounced.
“Ach! What did you kill them with?”
“An axe. I had it ready.”
“Ach, he is in a hurry! Alone?”
Nikolay did not understand the question.
“Did you do it alone?”
“Yes, alone. And Mitka is not guilty and had no share in it.”
“Don’t be in a hurry about Mitka! A-ach! How was it you ran downstairs like
that at the time? The porters met you both!”
“It was to put them off the scent... I ran after Mitka,” Nikolay replied
hurriedly, as though he had prepared the answer.
“I knew it!” cried Porfiry, with vexation. “It’s not his own tale he is telling,”
he muttered as though to himself, and suddenly his eyes rested on Raskolnikov
again.
He was apparently so taken up with Nikolay that for a moment he had
forgotten Raskolnikov. He was a little taken aback.
