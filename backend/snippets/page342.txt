They sat side by side, both mournful and dejected, as though they had been
cast up by the tempest alone on some deserted shore. He looked at Sonia and felt
how great was her love for him, and strange to say he felt it suddenly
burdensome and painful to be so loved. Yes, it was a strange and awful
sensation! On his way to see Sonia he had felt that all his hopes rested on her; he
expected to be rid of at least part of his suffering, and now, when all her heart
turned towards him, he suddenly felt that he was immeasurably unhappier than
before.
“Sonia,” he said, “you’d better not come and see me when I am in prison.”
Sonia did not answer, she was crying. Several minutes passed.
“Have you a cross on you?” she asked, as though suddenly thinking of it.
He did not at first understand the question.
“No, of course not. Here, take this one, of cypress wood. I have another, a
copper one that belonged to Lizaveta. I changed with Lizaveta: she gave me her
cross and I gave her my little ikon. I will wear Lizaveta’s now and give you this.
Take it... it’s mine! It’s mine, you know,” she begged him. “We will go to suffer
together, and together we will bear our cross!”
“Give it me,” said Raskolnikov.
He did not want to hurt her feelings. But immediately he drew back the hand
he held out for the cross.
“Not now, Sonia. Better later,” he added to comfort her.
“Yes, yes, better,” she repeated with conviction, “when you go to meet your
suffering, then put it on. You will come to me, I’ll put it on you, we will pray and
go together.”
At that moment someone knocked three times at the door.
“Sofya Semyonovna, may I come in?” they heard in a very familiar and polite
voice.
Sonia rushed to the door in a fright. The flaxen head of Mr. Lebeziatnikov
appeared at the door.
