There I acted stupidly
again. I fell to jeering in the coarsest way at all such propaganda and efforts to
convert me; Parasha came on to the scene again, and not she alone; in fact there
was a tremendous to-do. Ah, Rodion Romanovitch, if you could only see how
your sister’s eyes can flash sometimes! Never mind my being drunk at this
moment and having had a whole glass of wine. I am speaking the truth. I assure
you that this glance has haunted my dreams; the very rustle of her dress was
more than I could stand at last. I really began to think that I might become
epileptic. I could never have believed that I could be moved to such a frenzy. It
was essential, indeed, to be reconciled, but by then it was impossible. And
imagine what I did then! To what a pitch of stupidity a man can be brought by
frenzy! Never undertake anything in a frenzy, Rodion Romanovitch. I reflected

again), and I resolved to offer her all my money—thirty thousand roubles I could
have realised then—if she would run away with me here, to Petersburg. Of
course I should have vowed eternal love, rapture, and so on. Do you know, I was
so wild about her at that time that if she had told me to poison Marfa Petrovna or
to cut her throat and to marry herself, it would have been done at once! But it
ended in the catastrophe of which you know already. You can fancy how frantic I
was when I heard that Marfa Petrovna had got hold of that scoundrelly attorney,
Luzhin, and had almost made a match between them—which would really have
been just the same thing as I was proposing. Wouldn’t it? Wouldn’t it? I notice
that you’ve begun to be very attentive... you interesting young man....”
