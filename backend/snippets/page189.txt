“Very much,” answered Dounia.
“Foo!—what a pig you are!” Razumihin protested, blushing in terrible
confusion, and he got up from his chair. Pulcheria Alexandrovna smiled faintly,
but Raskolnikov laughed aloud.
“Where are you off to?”
“I must go.”
“You need not at all. Stay. Zossimov has gone, so you must. Don’t go. What’s
the time? Is it twelve o’clock? What a pretty watch you have got, Dounia. But
why are you all silent again? I do all the talking.”
“It was a present from Marfa Petrovna,” answered Dounia.
“And a very expensive one!” added Pulcheria Alexandrovna.
“A-ah! What a big one! Hardly like a lady’s.”
“I like that sort,” said Dounia.
“So it is not a present from her fiancé,” thought Razumihin, and was
unreasonably delighted.
“I thought it was Luzhin’s present,” observed Raskolnikov.
“No, he has not made Dounia any presents yet.”
“A-ah! And do you remember, mother, I was in love and wanted to get
married?” he said suddenly, looking at his mother, who was disconcerted by the
sudden change of subject and the way he spoke of it.
“Oh, yes, my dear.”
Pulcheria Alexandrovna exchanged glances with Dounia and Razumihin.
“H’m, yes. What shall I tell you? I don’t remember much indeed. She was
such a sickly girl,” he went on, growing dreamy and looking down again. “Quite
an invalid. She was fond of giving alms to the poor, and was always dreaming of
a nunnery, and once she burst into tears when she began talking to me about it.
Yes, yes, I remember. I remember very well. She was an ugly little thing. I really
don’t know what drew me to her then—I think it was because she was always ill.
If she had been lame or hunchback, I believe I should have liked her better still,”
he smiled dreamily. “Yes, it was a sort of spring delirium.”
