Raskolnikov walked after him.
“What’s this?” cried Svidrigaïlov turning round, “I thought I said...”
“It means that I am not going to lose sight of you now.”
“What?”
Both stood still and gazed at one another, as though measuring their strength.
“From all your half tipsy stories,” Raskolnikov observed harshly, “I am
positive that you have not given up your designs on my sister, but are pursuing
them more actively than ever. I have learnt that my sister received a letter this
morning. You have hardly been able to sit still all this time.... You may have
unearthed a wife on the way, but that means nothing. I should like to make
certain myself.”
Raskolnikov could hardly have said himself what he wanted and of what he
wished to make certain.
“Upon my word! I’ll call the police!”
“Call away!”
Again they stood for a minute facing each other. At last Svidrigaïlov’s face
changed. Having satisfied himself that Raskolnikov was not frightened at his
threat, he assumed a mirthful and friendly air.
“What a fellow! I purposely refrained from referring to your affair, though I
am devoured by curiosity. It’s a fantastic affair. I’ve put it off till another time,
but you’re enough to rouse the dead.... Well, let us go, only I warn you
beforehand I am only going home for a moment, to get some money; then I shall
lock up the flat, take a cab and go to spend the evening at the Islands. Now, now
are you going to follow me?”
“I’m coming to your lodgings, not to see you but Sofya Semyonovna, to say
I’m sorry not to have been at the funeral.”
