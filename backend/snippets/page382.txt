“Upon my word, I am not,” answered Svidrigaïlov laughing. “However, I
won’t dispute it, let me be a braggart, why not brag, if it hurts no one? I spent
seven years in the country with Marfa Petrovna, so now when I come across an
intelligent person like you—intelligent and highly interesting—I am simply glad
to talk and, besides, I’ve drunk that half-glass of champagne and it’s gone to my
head a little. And besides, there’s a certain fact that has wound me up
tremendously, but about that I... will keep quiet. Where are you off to?” he asked
in alarm.
Raskolnikov had begun getting up. He felt oppressed and stifled and, as it
were, ill at ease at having come here. He felt convinced that Svidrigaïlov was the
most worthless scoundrel on the face of the earth.
“A-ach! Sit down, stay a little!” Svidrigaïlov begged. “Let them bring you
some tea, anyway. Stay a little, I won’t talk nonsense, about myself, I mean. I’ll
tell you something. If you like I’ll tell you how a woman tried ‘to save’ me, as
you would call it? It will be an answer to your first question indeed, for the
woman was your sister. May I tell you? It will help to spend the time.”
“Tell me, but I trust that you...”
“Oh, don’t be uneasy. Besides, even in a worthless low fellow like me,
Avdotya Romanovna can only excite the deepest respect.”
