Svidrigaïlov was already in the carriage. Raskolnikov decided that his
suspicions were at least for that moment unjust. Without answering a word he
turned and walked back towards the Hay Market. If he had only turned round on
his way he might have seen Svidrigaïlov get out not a hundred paces off, dismiss
the cab and walk along the pavement. But he had turned the corner and could see
nothing. Intense disgust drew him away from Svidrigaïlov.
“To think that I could for one instant have looked for help from that coarse
brute, that depraved sensualist and blackguard!” he cried.
Raskolnikov’s judgment was uttered too lightly and hastily: there was
something about Svidrigaïlov which gave him a certain original, even a
mysterious character. As concerned his sister, Raskolnikov was convinced that
Svidrigaïlov would not leave her in peace. But it was too tiresome and
unbearable to go on thinking and thinking about this.
When he was alone, he had not gone twenty paces before he sank, as usual,
into deep thought. On the bridge he stood by the railing and began gazing at the
water. And his sister was standing close by him.
He met her at the entrance to the bridge, but passed by without seeing her.
Dounia had never met him like this in the street before and was struck with
dismay. She stood still and did not know whether to call to him or not. Suddenly
she saw Svidrigaïlov coming quickly from the direction of the Hay Market.
He seemed to be approaching cautiously. He did not go on to the bridge, but
stood aside on the pavement, doing all he could to avoid Raskolnikov’s seeing
him. He had observed Dounia for some time and had been making signs to her.
She fancied he was signalling to beg her not to speak to her brother, but to come
to him.
