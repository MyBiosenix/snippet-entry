He spent that evening till ten o’clock going from one low haunt to another.
Katia too turned up and sang another gutter song, how a certain
“villain and tyrant,”
“began kissing Katia.”
Svidrigaïlov treated Katia and the organ-grinder and some singers and the
waiters and two little clerks. He was particularly drawn to these clerks by the
fact that they both had crooked noses, one bent to the left and the other to the
right. They took him finally to a pleasure garden, where he paid for their
entrance. There was one lanky three-year-old pine-tree and three bushes in the
garden, besides a “Vauxhall,” which was in reality a drinking-bar where tea too
was served, and there were a few green tables and chairs standing round it. A
chorus of wretched singers and a drunken but exceedingly depressed German
clown from Munich with a red nose entertained the public. The clerks quarrelled
with some other clerks and a fight seemed imminent. Svidrigaïlov was chosen to
decide the dispute. He listened to them for a quarter of an hour, but they shouted
so loud that there was no possibility of understanding them. The only fact that
seemed certain was that one of them had stolen something and had even
succeeded in selling it on the spot to a Jew, but would not share the spoil with his
companion. Finally it appeared that the stolen object was a teaspoon belonging
to the Vauxhall. It was missed and the affair began to seem troublesome.
Svidrigaïlov paid for the spoon, got up, and walked out of the garden. It was
about six o’clock. He had not drunk a drop of wine all this time and had ordered
tea more for the sake of appearances than anything.
It was a dark and stifling evening. Threatening storm-clouds came over the
sky about ten o’clock. There was a clap of thunder, and the rain came down like
a waterfall. The water fell not in drops, but beat on the earth in streams. There
were flashes of lightning every minute and each flash lasted while one could
count five.
