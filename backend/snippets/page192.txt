“What surprises me,” he began, after a short pause, handing the letter to his
mother, but not addressing anyone in particular, “is that he is a business man, a
lawyer, and his conversation is pretentious indeed, and yet he writes such an
uneducated letter.”
They all started. They had expected something quite different.
“But they all write like that, you know,” Razumihin observed, abruptly.
“Have you read it?”
“Yes.”
“We showed him, Rodya. We... consulted him just now,” Pulcheria
Alexandrovna began, embarrassed.
“That’s just the jargon of the courts,” Razumihin put in. “Legal documents are
written like that to this day.”
“Legal? Yes, it’s just legal—business language—not so very uneducated, and
not quite educated—business language!”
“Pyotr Petrovitch makes no secret of the fact that he had a cheap education, he
is proud indeed of having made his own way,” Avdotya Romanovna observed,
somewhat offended by her brother’s tone.
“Well, if he’s proud of it, he has reason, I don’t deny it. You seem to be
offended, sister, at my making only such a frivolous criticism on the letter, and to
think that I speak of such trifling matters on purpose to annoy you. It is quite the
contrary, an observation apropos of the style occurred to me that is by no means
irrelevant as things stand. There is one expression, ‘blame yourselves’ put in
very significantly and plainly, and there is besides a threat that he will go away
at once if I am present. That threat to go away is equivalent to a threat to
abandon you both if you are disobedient, and to abandon you now after
summoning you to Petersburg. Well, what do you think? Can one resent such an
expression from Luzhin, as we should if he (he pointed to Razumihin) had
written it, or Zossimov, or one of us?”
“N-no,” answered Dounia, with more animation. “I saw clearly that it was too
naïvely expressed, and that perhaps he simply has no skill in writing... that is a
true criticism, brother. I did not expect, indeed...”
