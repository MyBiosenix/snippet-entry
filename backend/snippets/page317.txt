Katerina Ivanovna observed contemptuously that all knew what her family
was and that on that very certificate of honour it was stated in print that her
father was a colonel, while Amalia Ivanovna’s father—if she really had one—
was probably some Finnish milkman, but that probably she never had a father at
all, since it was still uncertain whether her name was Amalia Ivanovna or
Amalia Ludwigovna.
At this Amalia Ivanovna, lashed to fury, struck the table with her fist, and
shrieked that she was Amalia Ivanovna, and not Ludwigovna, “that her Vater
was named Johann and that he was a burgomeister, and that Katerina Ivanovna’s
Vater was quite never a burgomeister.” Katerina Ivanovna rose from her chair,
and with a stern and apparently calm voice (though she was pale and her chest
was heaving) observed that “if she dared for one moment to set her contemptible
wretch of a father on a level with her papa, she, Katerina Ivanovna, would tear
her cap off her head and trample it under foot.” Amalia Ivanovna ran about the
room, shouting at the top of her voice, that she was mistress of the house and
that Katerina Ivanovna should leave the lodgings that minute; then she rushed
for some reason to collect the silver spoons from the table. There was a great
outcry and uproar, the children began crying. Sonia ran to restrain Katerina
Ivanovna, but when Amalia Ivanovna shouted something about “the yellow
ticket,” Katerina Ivanovna pushed Sonia away, and rushed at the landlady to
carry out her threat.
At that minute the door opened, and Pyotr Petrovitch Luzhin appeared on the
threshold. He stood scanning the party with severe and vigilant eyes. Katerina
Ivanovna rushed to him.
