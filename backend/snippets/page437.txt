“Let me be,” she cried in despair. “I swear I’ll shoot again. I... I’ll kill you.”
“Well... at three paces you can hardly help it. But if you don’t... then.” His
eyes flashed and he took two steps forward. Dounia shot again: it missed fire.
“You haven’t loaded it properly. Never mind, you have another charge there.
Get it ready, I’ll wait.”
He stood facing her, two paces away, waiting and gazing at her with wild
determination, with feverishly passionate, stubborn, set eyes. Dounia saw that he
would sooner die than let her go. “And... now, of course she would kill him, at
two paces!” Suddenly she flung away the revolver.
“She’s dropped it!” said Svidrigaïlov with surprise, and he drew a deep breath.
A weight seemed to have rolled from his heart—perhaps not only the fear of
death; indeed he may scarcely have felt it at that moment. It was the deliverance
from another feeling, darker and more bitter, which he could not himself have
defined.
He went to Dounia and gently put his arm round her waist. She did not resist,
but, trembling like a leaf, looked at him with suppliant eyes. He tried to say
something, but his lips moved without being able to utter a sound.
“Let me go,” Dounia implored. Svidrigaïlov shuddered. Her voice now was
quite different.
“Then you don’t love me?” he asked softly. Dounia shook her head.
“And... and you can’t? Never?” he whispered in despair.
“Never!”
There followed a moment of terrible, dumb struggle in the heart of
Svidrigaïlov. He looked at her with an indescribable gaze. Suddenly he withdrew
his arm, turned quickly to the window and stood facing it. Another moment
passed.
“Here’s the key.”
He took it out of the left pocket of his coat and laid it on the table behind him,
without turning or looking at Dounia.
“Take it! Make haste!”
