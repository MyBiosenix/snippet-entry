“Then he was an author?”
“Yes, Mr. Captain, and what an ungentlemanly visitor in an honourable
house....”
“Now then! Enough! I have told you already...”
“Ilya Petrovitch!” the head clerk repeated significantly.
The assistant glanced rapidly at him; the head clerk slightly shook his head.
“... So I tell you this, most respectable Luise Ivanovna, and I tell it you for the
last time,” the assistant went on. “If there is a scandal in your honourable house
once again, I will put you yourself in the lock-up, as it is called in polite society.
Do you hear? So a literary man, an author took five roubles for his coat-tail in an
‘honourable house’? A nice set, these authors!”
And he cast a contemptuous glance at Raskolnikov. “There was a scandal the
other day in a restaurant, too. An author had eaten his dinner and would not pay;
‘I’ll write a satire on you,’ says he. And there was another of them on a steamer
last week used the most disgraceful language to the respectable family of a civil
councillor, his wife and daughter. And there was one of them turned out of a
confectioner’s shop the other day. They are like that, authors, literary men,
students, town-criers.... Pfoo! You get along! I shall look in upon you myself one
day. Then you had better be careful! Do you hear?”
With hurried deference, Luise Ivanovna fell to curtsying in all directions, and
so curtsied herself to the door. But at the door, she stumbled backwards against a
good-looking officer with a fresh, open face and splendid thick fair whiskers.
This was the superintendent of the district himself, Nikodim Fomitch. Luise
Ivanovna made haste to curtsy almost to the ground, and with mincing little
steps, she fluttered out of the office.
“Again thunder and lightning—a hurricane!” said Nikodim Fomitch to Ilya
Petrovitch in a civil and friendly tone. “You are aroused again, you are fuming
again! I heard it on the stairs!”
