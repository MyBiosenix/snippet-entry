“You hear, he knows Vahrushin,” cried Razumihin. “He is in ‘an intelligible
condition’! And I see you are an intelligent man too. Well, it’s always pleasant to
hear words of wisdom.”
“That’s the gentleman, Vahrushin, Afanasy Ivanovitch. And at the request of
your mamma, who has sent you a remittance once before in the same manner
